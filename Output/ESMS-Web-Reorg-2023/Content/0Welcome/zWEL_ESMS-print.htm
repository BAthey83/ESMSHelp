        <!-- (AF) Following is an example of how to write the popup link. The thing is, this is the very FIRST page to come up when the user opens BUILDER, so I'm not sure where to put this code: it would be one level up, and I am not succeeding in getting Properties to open for the (Flare) Content folder. And of course there would be no actual link that the user is clicking on with the text "Click here...". The specification would need to be at the computer level.  Anyhow, this is the example link:

    (Boutell)	When it comes time to actually open such a window, just write a link like the following:

		<a href="page.html" target="popup"
		onClick="wopen('page.html', 'popup', 640, 480); return false;"> Click here to open the page in a new window. </a>

                        <p>The Enterprise version of the Sustainment Management System (SMS)   is the newest version under development by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers at its Engineering Research and Development Center–Construction Engineering Research Laboratory (ERDC-CERL) in Champaign, IL. In contrast to legacy versions of the Sustainment Management System, which continue to be offered side by side with Enterprise SMS, the Enterprise version combines into one software program the information and capabilities formerly contained in separate products.</p>
                        <p>Enterprise SMS is currently available in Web format and desktop format:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Enterprise SMS Web allows users to import and access real property information from multiple domains formerly isolated from each other in separate products such as BUILDER™, RAILER™, and ROOFER™. This information can be utilized one domain at a time, or information from two or more domains can be viewed simultaneously.</li>
                            <li>The Desktop version of Enterprise SMS allows users to create as well as access real property inventory and assessment information, and to create and manage work plans for real property repair and replacement. <span class="span_1">Note:</span> At present, only the Fuels domain is active in the Desktop version of Enterprise SMS.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Once data has been entered or imported, automated tools in the SMS support engineering and facility management decisions regarding when, where, and how best to maintain buildings, roofs, pavements, rail lines, fuel lines, utilities, and their key components. For example, deterioration curves, developed from experience over time, show the optimal point at which work should be done to avoid more costly rehabilitation projects later.</p>
                        <p class="box indent">While the Sustainment Management System has been developed for military installations, it is applicable for any organization with facility management responsibilities. License agreements providing access to the SMS technology are available from multiple providers. </p>
