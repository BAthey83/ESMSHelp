        <h1><a name="kanchor851"></a>Enterprise SMS and SMS Inventory Differences</h1>
        <p class="indent"><span class="new-term">This topic is created to help with the transition from using legacy SMS to using Enterprise SMS. For a focus on differences in the inventory/asset tree between SMS and Enterprise SMS, see <a href="Appx-version-SMS-vs-ESMS.htm" class="MCXref xref" xrefformat="{paratext}">TURF THIS. Appendix A: Enterprise SMS vs SMS Inventory </a>.</span>
        </p>
        <h2>Topic Objectives</h2>
        <p>The objectives of this topic are:</p>
        <ol>
            <li value="1">To highlight differences between SMS modules and Enterprise SMS when adding and working with assets.</li>
            <li value="2">To introduce the new concept of <span class="new-term"><a href="#Groups" name="kanchor852">groups</a></span>, which exist as an organizational device apart from the asset tree. </li>
        </ol>
        <h2>Asset Tree Structure</h2>
        <p>For detail about the differences in structure between the Enterprise SMS asset tree and those of SMS modules, see <a href="Appx-version-SMS-vs-ESMS.htm" class="MCXref xref" xrefformat="{paratext}">TURF THIS. Appendix A: Enterprise SMS vs SMS Inventory </a>. The following documentation sections describe some differences beyond the asset tree structure.</p>
        <!--       <p>$$what permission level to add, edit, delete facility?</p> -->
        <h2>Adding Inventory</h2>
        <p>Differences in functionality and {objectives} between the Web and Desktop versions of Enterprise SMS lead to a "division of labor" for certain Enterprise SMS functions. </p>
        <p>Inventory is added to Enterprise SMS only through the Desktop version of the software, not via the Web. After adding inventory, you can use the synchronize (Sync) tool in the Desktop to upload the inventory to the Web version of Enterprise SMS. In Enterprise SMS Web, Sync capability is limited to selecting the site to be synchronized.</p>
        <h2>Working with Inventory Items (Assets)</h2>
        <p>In Enterprise SMS, no asset functions (such as adding and deleting) are accomplished via right-clicking on the asset in the tree, as is the case in BUILDER and ROOFER. Functions permitted to the current user will appear on the toolbar at the Assets page.</p>
        <h2>Groups</h2>
        <p>In addition to the asset tree, <span class="new-term">groups</span> are an optional, complementary device for organizing assets.</p>
        <p><a name="kanchor853"></a><a name="kanchor854"></a>Using groups in Enterprise SMS is a way to associate assets together. "Group" is not an asset tree level, but rather an optional property of an asset. With the exception of the SMS Utilities module (which was developed in the same time frame as the beginnings of Enterprise SMS), groups are a new concept introduced by Enterprise SMS.</p>
        <p> The selection of available groups is created by the end user's organization. A group may consist </p>
        <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
            <li value="1">entirely of components; </li>
            <li value="2">entirely of other groups; or</li>
            <li value="3">of a mixture of one or more components and one or more groups.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Groups, as an organizational element, have two levels:</p>
        <ol>
            <li value="1">Group-type</li>
            <li value="2">Within each group-type are the groups.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Groups allow disparate assets to be clustered together according to whatever quality is desired, such as a common location or common purpose.</p>
        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>$$Differences in functionality and {objectives} between the Web and Desktop versions of Enterprise SMS lead to a "division of labor" for certain Enterprise SMS functions. For inventory (assets), assets can be entered only in Enterprise SMS Desktop; then the inventory can be uploaded to Enterprise SMS Web using Sync.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>The SMS modules that are combined into Enterprise SMS as domains have varied hierarchies.$$</p>
