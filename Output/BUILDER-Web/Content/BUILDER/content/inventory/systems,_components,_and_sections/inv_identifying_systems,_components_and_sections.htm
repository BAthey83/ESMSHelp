            <h1>About Identifying Systems, Components and Sections</h1>
            <hr width="100%" size="0" align="center" />
            <p>This topic provides valuable advice to assist in the process of dividing Buildings into their constituent Systems, Component, and Component-Sections.</p>
            <hr width="100%" size="0" align="center" />
        </div>
        <p>After you <a href="../buildings/inv_adding_a_building.htm"><a href="../buildings/inv_adding_a_building.htm" class="MCXref xref">Add a Building</a></a> and have entered its required data elements, you should identify the Systems, Components and Component-Sections in the Building. Your decomposition of a Building into its Systems and the decomposition of those Systems into Components will be very straightforward. The formation of Component-Sections, however, will require some thought on your part. BUILDER manages Buildings at the Component-Section level, and you will inspect Component-Sections and plan work for Component-Sections. </p>
        <p>BUILDER's representation of Building Component-Sections has been designed for flexibility. With flexibility comes choices; choices that add complexity to the process. Pay particular attention to the subsection <a href="#def_secs" class="MCXref xref">Defining Component-Sections</a> <MadCapconditionalText data-mc-conditions="Primary.ScreenOnly" style="font-style: italic;"> below</MadCapconditionalText>.</p>
        <p>As an alternative option to adding all Systems, Components, and Component-Sections manually, BUILDER provides several mechanisms to speed the inventory process. For example, you can <a href="../rapid_inventory_methods/copying_a_building/inv_copying_a_building.htm" class="MCXref xref">Copy Inventory to Another Building</a> or <a href="../rapid_inventory_methods/building_templates/inv_creating_building_inventory_using_templates.htm" class="MCXref xref">Add Building Inventory Using a Template</a>.</p>
        <h2><a name="kanchor442"></a>Defining Systems</h2>
        <p>Systems are used to help you organize the records for the actual physical items in your Building. You may create only one System of each System type for any given Building. When you add a new System to a Building, the dropdown list of choices for which kind of System to add will include only those Systems that have not already been added to the Building. See <a href="systems/inv_add_system.htm" class="MCXref xref">Add a System</a> for details.</p>
        <h2><a name="kanchor443"></a>Defining Components</h2>
        <p>Like Systems, Components are used to help organize the records of the actual physical items in the Building. The Components that can be added to a System will depend on the System representation you have chosen for the Building. You may create only one Component of each type for each System. When you add a Component, the list of choices will include only those Components that have not already been created for that System. See <a href="components/inv_add_component.htm" class="MCXref xref">Add a Component</a> for details. </p>
        <p>If you have a Component that is not in the list of available Component options, please contact your <a href="javascript:void(0)" class="MCTextPopup MCTextPopupHotSpot MCTextPopup_Open glossaryTerm glossaryTermPopup MCTextPopupHotSpot_ MCTextPopupHotSpot_Popup" glossTerm="Primary.Term0" xmlns:MadCap="http://www.madcapsoftware.com/Schemas/MadCap.xsd">SMS<span class="MCTextPopupBody popupBody"><span class="MCTextPopupArrow"> </span>Sustainment Management System</span></a><span class="MCTextPopupBody popupBody">Sustainment Management System</span> support agent. BUILDER does not have a feature for user-defined Components. Each Component has a number of data elements associated with it (varieties of types and materials, costs, service lives, standard units of measure, inspectable subcomponents, etc.) which must be researched before the Component can be added. </p>
        <h2><a name="def_secs"></a><a name="kanchor444"></a>Defining Component-Sections</h2>
        <p>Component-Sections (also called Sections) of a Building are the key structures in a BUILDER inventory. The System and Component structures are organizational in nature, serving to categorize what is in a Building into manageable groups. Component-Sections actually represent the physical items of a Building, belong to a particular Component, and have the following properties: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>component type</li>
            <li>material/equipment type</li>
            <li>quantity</li>
            <li>age</li>
            <li>whether or not it is painted, and, if so, when it was last painted and paint type</li>
        </ul>
        <p>BUILDER has been designed to be flexible in allowing you to represent your Building's Component-Sections in a number of ways to support how you intend to manage them. Some examples may be helpful:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Building A has 5 exterior doors (System: Exterior Closure, Component: Exterior Door). Four of the doors are metal personnel doors and the fifth is a metal overhead door. Because there are two different types of doors (personnel, overhead), you will have to create at least two Component-Sections. In this situation, you should create a Component-Section for the metal overhead door and enter the appropriate data about it. You don't need to create a Component-Section name for this door because there is only one. For the four metal personnel doors, if you intend to manage them as a unit, create one more Component-Section and enter the appropriate data about the doors. Again, you don't need to enter a Component-Section name because you are only creating one Section of this material and type.</li>
            <li>Building A has 5 exterior doors (System: Exterior Closure, Component: Exterior Door). You lease Building A to two tenants X and Y. Two metal personnel doors and a metal overhead door are in the tenant X area, and the other two metal personnel doors are in the tenant Y area. Because you plan to inspect and maintain the doors by tenant, you create three Component-Sections:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Tenant X Metal Personnel with quantity 2</li>
                <li>Tenant X Metal Overhead with quantity 1</li>
                <li>Tenant Y Metal Personnel with quantity 2.</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>
        <p>When you create each Component-Section for Tenant X, you use "Tenant X" as the name of the Section. Do the same for Tenant Y. In fact, you may want to name every Section (especially Interior Construction Sections) in the Tenant X area "Tenant X." When you inspect the Building, you can use the Component-Section name to distinguish Component-Sections belonging to each of the tenants.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Building A has two reciprocating 20-ton chillers (System: HVAC, Component: Cooling Unit/Plant). If they are the same age and you plan to manage them as a unit, then create one Component-Section with quantity 2. However, if you want to manage them individually, or if they were installed at different times and may therefore have different maintenance requirements, then create two Component-Sections of quantity 1 each. Because both Component-Sections have the same equipment type (Reciprocating 20-30 Ton) and component type (Chillers), you will have to have distinct Component-Section names for the two Component-Sections. You may use their barcode IDs as the Component-Section names of you wish.</li>
            <li>Building B has 50 interior wood personnel doors, all alike and all installed when the Building was built. You originally create one Component-Section with quantity 50 for these doors. You may have several years of inspection data regarding the doors, which have deteriorated uniformly over time. With the current inspection, however, two of the doors are found to be severely damaged and will have to be replaced. If the two doors remain in their original Component-Section, inspection samples for these two doors will have to be marked as "non-representative." When the condition index is calculated, the condition of the two doors, which are only 4% of the Component-Section, will have only a small impact on the overall Section <a href="javascript:void(0)" class="MCTextPopup MCTextPopupHotSpot MCTextPopup_Open glossaryTerm glossaryTermPopup MCTextPopupHotSpot_ MCTextPopupHotSpot_Popup" glossTerm="ESMS-gloss.Term1" xmlns:MadCap="http://www.madcapsoftware.com/Schemas/MadCap.xsd">CI<span class="MCTextPopupBody popupBody"><span class="MCTextPopupArrow"> </span>Condition Index</span></a><span class="MCTextPopupBody popupBody">Condition Index</span>. Because you will be replacing the two doors, perhaps with a different quality of door because they may be subject to higher user abuse, you should use component sectioning to isolate the two doors. To do this, reduce the original Component-Section quantity to 48. Then create a new Component-Section for the two damaged doors and enter the current inspection data for this new Component-Section, which will then have a low <a href="javascript:void(0)" class="MCTextPopup MCTextPopupHotSpot MCTextPopup_Open glossaryTerm glossaryTermPopup MCTextPopupHotSpot_ MCTextPopupHotSpot_Popup" glossTerm="ESMS-gloss.Term1" xmlns:MadCap="http://www.madcapsoftware.com/Schemas/MadCap.xsd">CI<span class="MCTextPopupBody popupBody"><span class="MCTextPopupArrow"> </span>Condition Index</span></a><span class="MCTextPopupBody popupBody">Condition Index</span>.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>From these examples you can see that some thought will have to be given to how you decompose a Building into Component-Sections. Hopefully, you can also see that BUILDER is flexible enough to allow you to manage at the level of detail that you choose. See <a href="sections/about_sections.htm" class="MCXref xref">Working with Component-Sections</a> for details.</p>
        <h2><a name="kanchor445"></a>Inventory Suggestions</h2>
        <p>It is not necessary to do a complete inventory initially. Implementation funds and/or time may be limited, so it is possible and permissible to begin with only some of the Component-Sections and expand the inventory on an as-needed basis. If the desire is to begin with a limited set, the following suggestions are made:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Focus on the Components that are most critical to Building function</li>
            <li>Focus on the Components that traditionally dominate Maintenance and Rehabilitation (<a href="javascript:void(0)" class="MCTextPopup MCTextPopupHotSpot MCTextPopup_Open MCTextPopupHotSpot_ MCTextPopupHotSpot_Popup #text #textPopup"><a href="javascript:void(0)" class="MCTextPopup MCTextPopupHotSpot MCTextPopup_Open glossaryTerm glossaryTermPopup MCTextPopupHotSpot_ MCTextPopupHotSpot_Popup" glossTerm="Primary.Term53" xmlns:MadCap="http://www.madcapsoftware.com/Schemas/MadCap.xsd">M&amp;R<span class="MCTextPopupBody popupBody"><span class="MCTextPopupArrow"> </span>Maintenance and Rehabilitation</span></a><span class="MCTextPopupBody popupBody">Maintenance and Rehabilitation</span></a>) needs.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>When sectioning, a few rules of thumb are offered:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>To avoid a data burden, use the smallest number of Sections possible to meet managerial needs. For example, it is usually not necessary to individually Section every room, each exterior wall, etc.
            </li>
            <li>Because material differences (e.g. wood vs. masonry) are criteria for sectioning, only create Sections for material differences when the quantity is significant enough to warrant individual management attention. For example, an exterior wall may be made of wood, but a few square feet of wall is made of masonry, essentially for decoration. The wood wall is clearly a Section, but what about the masonry? Should it be its own Section? If the masonry quantity is a mere fraction of the wood and work would be accomplished on the masonry at the same time as the wood (in other words, the entire wall is being managed as a unit), then there is no need to create a Section just for the masonry. However, if the quantities of both the wood and masonry are significant, then create Sections for both.
            </li>
            <li>Equipment sectioning should be thought out carefully when multiple units of the same equipment are present. For example, there may be three air handling units of the same type, age, etc. In this case, there could be one Section with the quantity of three, or three Sections with the quantity of one. Which approach should be taken? If the desire is to manage them as essentially one unit as far as planning repair and replacement, then one Section will suffice. However, if it is expected that over time, they will be replaced individually, etc, then each should be its own Section.
            </li>
            <li>Obtaining accurate an accurate quantity can be difficult, and often times there are many sources for obtaining quantity. These include drawings, actual measurement or count, or other records. It must be understood that the more detailed or accurate the count or measurement, the more costly it is to collect the data. Extracting information from records, including drawings, and doing a field validation is the most costly. Reasonable estimates within reasonable error are very acceptable as it will result in reasonable error in BUILDER's analyses. For example, the wall finish may truly be 10,634 SF. An estimate of 11,000 SF will suffice for planning purposes especially if the cost to get the true value is twice that for an estimate. Component-Sections that cover an area (SF or SM) are the most difficult to obtain with precision whereas those that are "each" are the easiest. Generally, field count the "each" Component-Sections and estimate the others. The estimates can be refined in the future when projects are developed for <a href="javascript:void(0)" class="MCTextPopup MCTextPopupHotSpot MCTextPopup_Open MCTextPopupHotSpot_ MCTextPopupHotSpot_Popup #text #textPopup"><a href="javascript:void(0)" class="MCTextPopup MCTextPopupHotSpot MCTextPopup_Open glossaryTerm glossaryTermPopup MCTextPopupHotSpot_ MCTextPopupHotSpot_Popup" glossTerm="Primary.Term53" xmlns:MadCap="http://www.madcapsoftware.com/Schemas/MadCap.xsd">M&amp;R<span class="MCTextPopupBody popupBody"><span class="MCTextPopupArrow"> </span>Maintenance and Rehabilitation</span></a><span class="MCTextPopupBody popupBody">Maintenance and Rehabilitation</span></a> work.</li>

In those cases, make a reasonable estimate and mark the <span class="span_1" style="font-weight: bold;">Estimated</span> checkbox. Often, there are people who will remember when that work was done, at least in a generalized way (e.g. early 1990s).
