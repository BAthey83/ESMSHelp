        <h1><a name="kanchor733"></a>Working with Rapid Inventory Methods</h1>
        <hr width="100%" size="0" align="center" />
        <p>This topic gives an overview of three ways that the BUILDER inventory creation process can be made faster. These methods depend on a level of similarity between Sections or Buildings.</p>
        <hr width="100%" size="0" align="center" />
        <p class="indent"><span class="span_1" style="font-weight: bold;">Note:</span> A previously available method, Embedded Building Models, has been discontinued.</p>
        <p>One of the most time-consuming aspects of inventory is the decomposition of a Building into its Systems, Components, and Sections. To help with this Building decomposition, BUILDER™ has multiple alternative methods designed to help you quickly establish an inventory database for your Buildings. The main toolbar icon for each is shown in the listing below. </p>

If you have need of embedded models, one option is to speak to your BUILDER support representative for information on how to populate embedded models with data. Alternatively, creating and sharing Building templates is another way to achieve the same objective.</p> -->
        <h2>Method Availability</h2>
        <h3>Site and Complex Level</h3>
        <p>At the Site and Complex level, these methods are available:</p>
        <ul>
            <!--            <li>Rapid Inventory Estimation (<span class="span_1">Note:</span> This method requires an elevated user permissions level)</li> -->
            <li>Copy the inventory of one Building into another Building</li>
            <li>Create and use Building templates</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The icons for these methods sit side by side on the BUILDER toolbar at the inventory levels where they are available for use. </p>

        <h3>Building Level</h3>
        <p>At the Building level, the Copy Sections tool also becomes available:</p>

        <!--       <h2>Method 1: Rapid Inventory Estimation Using Embedded Building Models</h2>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>BUILDER provides a set of embedded Building models complete with an initial breakdown into Systems, Components, and Sections based on the Building Use category, size, age, and number of floors. These Building models were established by the Department of Defense under the Unified Facilities Criteria (UFC) system and published in the DoD Facilities Pricing Guide. </p>
        <p>Users have a choice between two model styles:</p>
        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="Embedded_Building_Models/snpTwo_Rapid_Model_Styles.flsnp" />
        <p>Using the DoD model can be less work if your Building is very similar to it; however, it increases the chance that your Building will contain inaccurate information that has not yet been updated. </p>
        <h3>Embedded Building Model Styles</h3>
        <p>When using BUILDER's Rapid Inventory Estimation, you have a choice between two model styles:</p>
        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="Embedded_Building_Models/snpTwo_Rapid_Model_Styles.flsnp" />
        <h4>Choosing a Style</h4>
        <p>Some factors to consider when choosing are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Level of retained control desired by your organization. If you use the default model, material type and component type are not specified by the model, and there is a lower chance that your Building will contain inaccurate information that has not yet been updated. The need for intervention at that level of detail will be more obvious when using the default embedded model.</li>
            <li>Perceived amount of similarity between your Building(s) and the DoD model details. The judgment call here is whether it will be less work to <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;"><li> check the accuracy of material/equipment category and component type in entries fully filled in by the DoD model, and change the details where they differ from actual; or</li><li> methodically fill in material/equipment category and component type for lower-level entries filled in by the default model (or perhaps this detailed level of information will not be needed right away).</li></ol></li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Usage Tip</h3>
        <p>After applying either Building style model, you will be able to edit the data for each Building to increase accuracy. This refinement of the data can be done gradually over time as your needs require and as more accurate data becomes available. </p>
        <h3>Embedded Building Model Availability</h3>
        <p>A limited selection of embedded Building models is available. Your SMS support agent should be able to provide you with a list of the Building Use codes for which a model is available.</p>
        <h3>Getting Started</h3>
        <p>For instructions on using embedded Building models, see <MadCap:xref href="Embedded_Building_Models/RI_Populating_Buildings_using_RI.htm">Use Embedded Building Models to Populate Buildings</MadCap:xref>.</p> -->
        <h2>List of Rapid Inventory Methods</h2>
        <h3>Method 1: Copy the Inventory of One Building into Another</h3>
        <p> One method that can ease the data input process is to copy the existing inventory of one Building into another Building. This provides a starter set of Systems, Components, and Sections that can then be refined, instead of all entered from scratch The amount of refinement needed will depend on the amount of similarity between the structures.</p>
        <p>This inventory creation method is especially useful if you have a number of Buildings in your inventory that were all built at the same time using the same plans and specifications. </p>
        <p class="indent"><span class="span_1" style="font-weight: bold;">Tip:</span> If you have more than two or three Buildings or facilities that are very similar to each other, you should consider creating a Building template instead of copying from another Building. If one of the applicable Buildings is already created and populated, it can be used to create that template.</p>
        <p>For instructions on copying inventory from another Building, see <a href="copying_a_building/inv_copying_a_building.htm" class="MCXref xref">Copy Inventory to Another Building</a>.</p>
        <h3>Method 2: Copy Sections</h3>
        <p>Within a Building, the process of adding inventory can be accelerated by using the Copy Sections tool, which allows you to copy pre-existing Sections from one area of a Building to another area of the same Building. An example of when to use this tool is in a multistory building with similar or identical inventory on multiple floors. The first floor can be inventoried and then copied to other floors, saving time and reducing inventory costs. </p>
        <p>For instructions, see <a href="copying_sections/inv_copy_sections.htm" class="MCXref xref">Copy Sections</a>.</p>
        <h3>Method 3: Create and Use Building Templates</h3>
        <p>Building templates are "cookie cutter" models that can be used to create Buildings with identical features. These template-generated Buildings can be used to get your inventory task off to a fast start, because their contents only need editing and adapting instead of each inventory item and sub-item being entered from scratch.</p>
