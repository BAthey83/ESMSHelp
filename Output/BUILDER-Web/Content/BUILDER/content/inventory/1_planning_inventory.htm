        <p>Your BUILDER™ inventory serves as the foundation for all that you will do with the BUILDER application. The first steps in using BUILDER are (1) to plan the hierarchical asset "tree" describing the physical inventory you manage (the subject of this topic) and (2) to construct the upper levels of that tree. The next step is to perform inventory to fill the database represented by that hierarchical tree. </p>
        <p>The process of putting initial data into BUILDER will probably be your single most intensive effort in working with the program, but it is a one-time effort that can be aided by features described in the section on <a href="rapid_inventory_methods/ri_methods_overview.htm">Rapid Inventory Methods</a>.</p>
        <p class="indent"><span class="span_1">Tip:</span>  Crucial to the planning process for a new implementation of <span class="mc-variable Primary.Product variable">BUILDER</span> is the issue of who decides the scope and organization of the hierarchical asset tree. It is recommended that this high-level planning step)–determining the scope and organization of the tree)–not be contracted out, even if "filling in" the asset tree at the lower levels (Buildings or Complexes and below) will be performed by contractors. A useful planning guidance document for government agencies and their contractors is ERDC/CERL <a href="javascript:void(0)" class="MCTextPopup MCTextPopupHotSpot MCTextPopup_Open glossaryTerm glossaryTermPopup MCTextPopupHotSpot_ MCTextPopupHotSpot_Popup" glossTerm="Primary.Term20" xmlns:MadCap="http://www.madcapsoftware.com/Schemas/MadCap.xsd">SR<span class="MCTextPopupBody popupBody"><span class="MCTextPopupArrow"> </span>Shingle Roofing</span></a><span class="MCTextPopupBody popupBody">Shingle Roofing</span> 16-3, <span class="span_9">BUILDER™ Sustainment Management System Implementation Planning Guide</span>, downloadable at <a href="https://support.sms.erdc.dren.mil/downloads/erdc-cerl-technical-publications">https://support.sms.erdc.dren.mil/downloads/erdc-cerl-technical-publications</a>.</p>
        <h2>Planning the Organizational Structure</h2>
        <h3><a name="kanchor270"></a>Organization Level</h3>
        <p data-mc-conditions="Primary.35">Because the most convenient approach is to build out the <span class="mc-variable Primary.Product variable" style="font-weight: bold;">BUILDER</span> asset tree from the top down, if you are introducing <span class="mc-variable Primary.Product variable" style="font-weight: bold;">BUILDER</span> for the first time and creating the tree structure for your real property data, it is preferable to analyze in advance the final scope anticipated for entry and management of properties, and to create the Organization levels that will be needed in the long run even if they will not be filled with content in the short run. </p>
        <p>Organizations are unique in the <span class="mc-variable Primary.Product variable" style="font-weight: bold;">BUILDER</span> hierarchy in that they can be nested multiple levels deep if desired. Note, however, that this flexibility brings with it the responsibility for careful planning.</p>
        <h3><a name="kanchor271"></a>Site Level</h3>
        <p>Begin by grouping your Buildings into logical management units, typically by their geographic regions, which are represented by <a href="sites/about_sites.htm">Site records</a> in the <span class="mc-variable Primary.Product variable" style="font-weight: bold;">BUILDER</span> database. The Site provides a natural way to group Buildings and to apply properties that are regional in nature, such as the cost of operations and maintenance (O&amp;M) work and the heating, ventilation and cooling (HVAC) climate.</p>
        <h3><a name="kanchor272"></a>Building Level</h3>
        <p>Next, <a href="buildings/inv_adding_a_building.htm">create Building records</a> for the Buildings at one of your Sites. A Building record includes critical information such as how the Building is used, its size, age, and number of floors. You will find that <span class="mc-variable Primary.Product variable" style="font-weight: bold;">BUILDER</span> also allows you to store, at your option, a variety of other information about a Building, such as whether it is a historical structure or a whether it is a child-occupied facility. You will also have the option to establish a <a href="../tools/mdi/tools_mission_dependency_index_overview.htm">Mission Dependency Index</a> to measure quantitatively how critical the Building is to the mission for which it is used.</p>
        <h3><a name="kanchor273"></a>Complex Level</h3>
        <p>Conceptually, the Complex level in the <span class="mc-variable Primary.Product variable" style="font-weight: bold;">BUILDER</span> hierarchy comes between the Site level and the Building level. However, unlike a Site, a Complex for organizing Buildings is <span class="span_9" style="font-style: italic;">optional</span>, and a Complex is often not created until after its constituent Buildings (or at least some of them) have been added to <span class="mc-variable Primary.Product variable">BUILDER</span>.</p>
        <h3><a name="kanchor274"></a>System Level</h3>
        <p>After establishing the Building level, you begin working down toward the end level of Component-Sections hierarchically, starting with the major Systems of a Building. The Systems in BUILDER are specified by       
                <a name="kanchor275"></a>the UNIFORMAT II Classification for Building Elements (Level 2), as shown in <a href="systems,_components,_and_sections/systems/inv_builder_systems-table.htm" class="MCXref xref">BUILDER Systems and Components</a>.  </p>
        <p>You will create the Building's Systems by selecting each applicable System from a dropdown pick list. See <a href="systems,_components,_and_sections/systems/inv_builder_systems-table.htm" class="MCXref xref">BUILDER Systems and Components</a> for a list of available Systems.</p>
        <p>For advice on how best to allocate inventory into Systems, Components, and Sections, see <a href="systems,_components,_and_sections/inv_identifying_systems,_components_and_sections.htm" class="MCXref xref">About Identifying Systems, Components and Sections</a>.</p>
        <h3><a name="kanchor276"></a>Component Level</h3>
        <p>Each System is further decomposed into Components (UNIFORMAT Level 3 elements). Again, you will create the Component records by selecting from a pick list of Components applicable to a given System. <a href="systems,_components,_and_sections/systems/inv_builder_systems-table.htm" class="MCXref xref">BUILDER Systems and Components</a> shows a selection of typical Components for some of the BUILDER Systems. </p>
        <h3><a name="kanchor277"></a><a name="kanchor278"></a>Component-Section Level</h3>
        <p>Creating the Component-Section ("Section")&#160;records is the most difficult and time-consuming aspect of creating the BUILDER inventory</p>
        <p>After creating records for at least one System and at least one Component in a System, you are ready to add records that describe the individual physical items in the Building: the doors, walls, windows, plumbing fixtures, heating units, etc. These items are called Component-Sections, or simply Sections. </p>
        <p>Component-Sections are the management unit in BUILDER. You inspect them and plan work for them, and BUILDER applies its condition assessment algorithms to them in calculating their condition index. </p>
        <p>BUILDER uses embedded data and automated processes to determine a wealth of information about each Component-Section: its expected service life, its likely subcomponents and how its condition affects the Section as a whole, and the cost of replacing, painting, repairing, and removing it. As you might imagine, for an automated system to be able to do all of this, there are some strict rules about how you define Component-Sections. </p>
        <div class="kt">
            <p>A Component-Section consists of items that meet all of these criteria: </p>
            <ol>
                <li value="1">All belong to the same Component.</li>
                <li value="2">All are of the same Component type.</li>
                <li value="3">All are of the same material/equipment category.</li>
            </ol>
        </div>
        <p>For example, in the Component "Exterior Doors," glass personnel doors and metal overhead doors belong in different Sections. </p>
        <p>As long as the requirement for not mingling (a)&#160;types or (b)&#160;material/equipment category in the same Component-Section is met, you will have considerable flexibility in how you group similar items together to form a Component-Section. For example, wood doors on different sides of the Building could be grouped together. Alternatively, if weather degradation based on compass orientation is a significant factor, then west doors, north doors, etc. might be assigned to separate Component-Sections.</p>
        <p>Once a Component-Section has been identified by (1)&#160;Component type and (2)&#160;material/equipment category, BUILDER will have sufficient information to establish a clear link between the Section (Component-Section) and the embedded data and computations that BUILDER brings to the process in order to help you with your management tasks.</p>
