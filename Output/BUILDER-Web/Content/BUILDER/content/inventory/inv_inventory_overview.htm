        <p>This topic provides a brief overview of the inventory process, both for those approaching the task of planning and implementing an initial inventory of assets, and for those who will be updating and managing an existing real property inventory database in <span class="mc-variable Primary.Product variable">BUILDER</span>™.</p>
        <p>Those planning an initial inventory should also read <a href="1_planning_inventory.htm" class="MCXref xref">Planning Inventory</a>.</p>

        <h2>New <span class="mc-variable Primary.Product variable">BUILDER</span> Implementation</h2>
        <p>BUILDER inventory serves as the foundation for all that your organization will do with the BUILDER application. The first step in a new implementation of BUILDER is to construct a database that describes the physical inventory that is to be managed. That process of putting the data into BUILDER will probably be the single most intensive effort in working with the program, but it is a one-time effort that can be aided by features that allow you to import data from other Systems; to <a href="rapid_inventory_methods/copying_a_building/inv_copying_a_building.htm">copy Buildings</a>; and to use <a href="rapid_inventory_methods/building_templates/inv_using_building_templates.htm">Building templates</a> when multiple Buildings have a single or similar design.</p>
        <p>Depending on manpower and other considerations, your organization may choose to perform inventory and initial inspections (condition assessment) for a new <span class="mc-variable Primary.Product variable">BUILDER</span> implementation at the same time. Alternatively, inventory can be performed first, and then inspections.</p>
        <p>Initial inventory demands significant resources. Some organizations choose to hire either contractors or additional staff temporarily for the task of populating the inventory tree. However, the task of <span class="span_9">planning</span> the scope and structure of the asset tree is typically best done by someone already familiar with the relevant organization. </p>
        <p>The topic <a href="1_planning_inventory.htm" class="MCXref xref">Planning Inventory</a> provides advice for planning the structure of your inventory and for determining how to divide inventory into Systems, Components, and Sections. </p>
        <!--
        <p>There is also the option to record inventory information gradually. ((Not recommended??)) : One approach is to go broad, populating the tree fully at the Site/Complex/Building level first, </p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>The other approach to recording inventory information gradually is to go deep, choosing the highest priority structures and fully populating them down to the Section level. With this approach, you </p>
        <p>However, to get the full benefit of what <MadCap:variable name="Primary.Product" /> can do, **</p>
        <p>set up a bare-bones structure at Organization, Site, and Building level with minimal information, and then adhere to a schedule of filling out the detail **. the disadvantages of this approach are **a and **b. Another approach is to ((hm, thought I had "wide" and "deep" taken care of, but NOT&#160;REALLY.))</p>

        <h2>Managing and Updating Inventory</h2>
        <p>After a description of physical property has been entered into the database during initial inventory–or possibly in parallel to initial inventory, if the inventory tree is being filled in gradually–comes  the task of managing and updating inventory. Representative tasks of this phase are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Newly acquired Sections, Systems, or Buildings need to be added to the inventory tree. </li>
            <li>As Components and Component-Sections are replaced due to poor condition or modernization, the corresponding records need to be updated in the database.</li>
        </ul>
