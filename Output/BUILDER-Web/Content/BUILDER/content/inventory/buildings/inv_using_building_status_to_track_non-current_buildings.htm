        <p>
            <hr width="100%" size="0" align="center" />
        </p>
        <p>This topic shows how the Current Status property can be used to keep historical records of demolished or transferred Buildings, or to anticipate short-term and long-term needs for Buildings about to be built or otherwise acquired.</p>
        <p>
            <hr width="100%" size="0" align="center" />
        </p>
        <p>The Building-level Current Status property allows you to have records in your <span class="mc-variable Primary.Product variable">BUILDER</span> database for Buildings that are not currently in your physical inventory. This is useful for Buildings at both ends of the lifecycle. You may keep records for Buildings that have been demolished or transferred, and you may add Buildings planned for future construction or acquisition. </p>
        <h2>Add Future Buildings</h2>
        <p>Using the Current Status property, it is possible to enter Buildings into the database before they are actually in the physical inventory. This includes Buildings under construction (designated with status "To be built") and existing Buildings being considered for acquisition from another owner (designated with status "To be acquired"). </p>
        <h3>"To Be Acquired"</h3>
        <p>By setting the Current Status property to "To be acquired" and entering data in advance, you will be able to anticipate short-term work requirements for existing Buildings about to be acquired. In <span class="mc-variable Primary.Product variable">BUILDER</span>, the "To be acquired" status can also be used to plan long-term maintenance requirements for future Buildings using Scenarios.</p>
        <h4>Enter Inventory Records</h4>
        <p>Use this status to enter inventory records for a new Building prior to its acquisition. </p>
        <h4>Record Inspection Results</h4>
        <p>Once you have entered inventory records for a Building with status "To be acquired," you may record inspection results prior to acquisition. The <span class="mc-variable Primary.Product variable">BUILDER</span> processes that determine remaining service life and condition prediction will track the condition of the Building after it is first entered and prior to its acquisition. </p>
        <h4>Generate a Work Plan</h4>
        <p>With inspection results, <span class="mc-variable Primary.Product variable">BUILDER</span> will be able to generate a work plan for the Building to upgrade it (or its roofing, in the case of <span class="mc-variable Primary.2ndProduct variable">ROOFER</span>) to your established standards. Such information could be invaluable in planning for the load such a Building will place on both short and long term budgets.</p>
        <h3>"To Be Built"</h3>
        <h4>Enter Inventory Records</h4>
        <p>Use this status to enter inventory records for a new Building prior to its commissioning for occupancy.</p>
        <h4>No Recording of Inspection Results</h4>
        <p>If you enter a Building with status "To be built," you may not record new inspections until the status changes to "Active." The <span class="mc-variable Primary.Product variable" style="font-weight: bold;">BUILDER</span> processes that determine remaining service life and condition prediction will skip such a Building under the assumption that quality assurance during the construction process will force all Systems to a condition index of 100 prior to commissioning. </p>
        <h4>Use Scenarios to Simulate "Active" Status (BUILDER Only)</h4>
        <p>The advantage of entering the Building before it is built is that you may include it in Scenarios to measure its long-term effects on work plans and budgets That is, the scenario can change the status of a new Building to "Active" at a scheduled time and begin treating it as a normal Building with predictable deterioration rates and work requirements.</p>
        <h2>Keep Records of Past Buildings (Demolished, Transferred)</h2>
        <p>In earlier versions of <span class="mc-variable Primary.Product variable" style="font-weight: bold;">BUILDER</span>, the only way to exclude a Building from automated assessment and planning processes was to <a href="inv_deleting_a_building.htm">delete the Building</a>. With this approach, all records related to the Building were actually deleted from the database. </p>
        <p>Now the Current Status property gives you another option. </p>
        <p>If you have records in the <span class="mc-variable Primary.Product variable" style="font-weight: bold;">BUILDER</span> database for a Building which is to be demolished or transferred to another owner, you can keep the inventory, inspection, and work history records in the database, while at the same time making the Building invisible to <span class="mc-variable Primary.Product variable" style="font-weight: bold;">BUILDER</span>'s automated processes, simply by changing the Building's status to "Demolished" or "Transferred."</p>
        <p class="indent"><span class="span_1" style="font-weight: bold;">Best Practice Recommendation:</span> When you delete a Building, you actually remove all database records associated with that Building. If you wish to keep the records, whether for historical purposes, analysis, or possible transfer to another <span class="mc-variable Primary.Product variable" style="font-weight: bold;">BUILDER</span> database (perhaps the Building is being transferred from one property book to another), then you should simply set the Current Status property to the appropriate value, either "Demolished" or "Transferred."</p>
        <p>Below is a summary of what happens when<!-- /Scenarios--> a Building has the status of either "Demolished" or "Transferred": </p>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="span_1" style="font-weight: bold;">Inventory records are locked.</span> You will be unable to change the Building's data properties or its composition. </li>
