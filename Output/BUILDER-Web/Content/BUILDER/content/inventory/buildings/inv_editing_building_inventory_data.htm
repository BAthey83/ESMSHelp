            <p>This topic describes the information that can be found and edited at the <span class="span_1" style="font-weight: bold;">General Information </span>tab on the Building screen. Additional Building information is described in<MadCapconditionalText data-mc-conditions="Primary.ScreenOnly"> <a href="inv_edit_additional_building_data.htm" class="MCXref xref">Edit Additional Building Inventory Data</a>.</MadCapconditionalText></p>

            <p>The sections below, as well as the topic<MadCapconditionalText data-mc-conditions="Primary.ScreenOnly"> <a href="inv_edit_additional_building_data.htm" class="MCXref xref">Edit Additional Building Inventory Data</a></MadCapconditionalText>, describe information that can be obtained about and actions that can be performed on the Building.</p>
        </div>
        <p>To view and edit Building inventory data, select the Building in the inventory tree.</p>
        <p class="p_26" style="text-align: center;">
            <img src="invent_bldgs_detail_950x450.png" alt="" style="width: 950;height: 450;" />
        </p>
        <p class="result">By default, the <span class="span_1" style="font-weight: bold;">General Information</span> tab (abbreviated <span class="span_1" style="font-weight: bold;">General Info</span>) will appear.</p>
        <h2>ID Line</h2>
        <p>On the ID line, you can edit the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="span_1" style="font-weight: bold;">Building ID Number</span>. The ID Number is limited to 12 alphanumeric characters. <![CDATA[            ]]></li>
            <li><span class="span_1" style="font-weight: bold;">Building Name</span>. Building Name is allowed 50 alphanumeric characters. <span class="span_1" style="font-weight: bold;">Best Practice Recommendation:</span> Avoid using single quotes, double quotes, and ampersands. These characters can interfere with query formation. </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>General Building Information Tab</h2>
        <p>Initially after a Building is selected in the inventory tree, the <span class="span_1" style="font-weight: bold;">General Information</span> tab is shown with the following information, all of which is required:</p>
        <h3>Type, Age, and Size Data</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="span_1"><a name="kanchor324" style="font-weight: bold;"></a><b>Building Use</b></span>. From the dropdown list, select the Building Use category that most closely matches the Building's use. For a Department of Defense activity, <span class="mc-variable Primary.Product variable" style="font-weight: bold;">BUILDER</span> should display familiar category codes for your service.</li>
            <li><span class="span_1" style="font-weight: bold;">Current Status</span>. From the dropdown list, select the appropriate Building status. See <a href="inv_about_the_building_status_property.htm" class="MCXref xref">About the Building Current Status Property</a> for more information. Status type options include:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Active</li>
                <li>To be acquired</li>
                <li>To be built</li>
                <li>To be demolished</li>
                <li>To be transferred</li>
                <li>Demolished</li>
                <li>Transferred</li>
                <li>Vacant</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The options "To be acquired" and "To be built" allow you to enter future Buildings into the inventory and to plan for their maintenance in Scenarios even though they are not presently owned. Along with Transferred and Demolished, these options allow you to keep information about the Building in your database without the data on these Buildings affecting your current condition indices.</p>
            <p>The options "Transferred" and "Demolished" allow you to keep records for Buildings that are no longer in the physical inventory. Such records are ignored in processes that should only consider current Buildings, such as condition rollups and work planning.</p>
            <li><span class="span_1" style="font-weight: bold;">Effective Year of Status</span>. When you select a Building status other than the default "Active" status, you must also provide a year in which the permanent status will take effect. For vacant, demolished, and transferred Buildings, the effective year is the year the action occurred. For future ("To be") status options, the effective year is the year the future event will occurâ€“i.e., the year the Building will actually be built, acquired, transferred, or demolished.</li>
            <li><a name="kanchor325"></a><span class="span_1" style="font-weight: bold;">Construction Type</span>. Select the construction type from the dropdown list that matches the Building. Construction type options include:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Permanent</li>
                <li>Semi-Permanent</li>
                <li>Temporary</li>
                <li>Leased</li>
            </ul>
            <li><span class="span_1" style="font-weight: bold;">Area</span>. Enter the gross area of the Building.</li>
            <li><span class="span_1" style="font-weight: bold;">Year Constructed</span>.Enter the year that construction of the Building was completed. This data element determines the age of the Building, which is a critical factor in <span class="mc-variable Primary.Product variable">BUILDER</span>'s decision-making processes.</li>
            <li><span class="span_1" style="font-weight: bold;">Number of Floors</span>. Enter the number of floors of the Building. This data element is used to estimate the size of the Building's footprint by dividing the area by the number of floors.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Calculated Data</h3>
        <p>Data calculated by <span class="mc-variable Primary.Product variable" style="font-weight: bold;">BUILDER</span> is usually read-only. However, <span class="span_1" style="font-weight: bold;">Replacement Cost</span> and <span class="span_1">Mission Dependency Index (<a href="javascript:void(0)" class="MCTextPopup MCTextPopupHotSpot MCTextPopup_Open glossaryTerm glossaryTermPopup MCTextPopupHotSpot_ MCTextPopupHotSpot_Popup" glossTerm="ESMS-gloss.Term3" xmlns:MadCap="http://www.madcapsoftware.com/Schemas/MadCap.xsd">MDI<span class="MCTextPopupBody popupBody"><span class="MCTextPopupArrow"> </span>Mission Dependency Index - measures the relative importance of a Building</span></a><span class="MCTextPopupBody popupBody">Mission Dependency Index - measures the relative importance of a Building</span>)</span> each have a checkbox that allows manual entry or manual override of the system-calculated figure.</p>

This data element contains the current replacement cost for a Building of the current Building's use and size under current construction standards. <span class="mc-variable Primary.Product variable" style="font-weight: bold;">BUILDER</span> provides a cost module to estimate the replacement cost. If you don't check the manual override checkbox, the cost module will update the replacement cost using the default cost book, adjusted for inflation and geographic location when costs are updated.

           
                <p class="indent"><span class="span_1" style="font-weight: bold;">CAUTION:</span> If you check the manual override checkbox, the cost module will not affect this Building's replacement cost, and you will have to periodically update its replacement cost manually to account for inflation.</p><p class="indent"><span class="span_1" style="font-weight: bold;">Note:</span> Geographic location is set at the Site level.
