        <h3><a name="How"></a>How to Use the Lookup Location Button to Set Site Location Factors</h3>
        <p>Site location factors can be set or changed after you add the Site to the inventory tree. To manually set values for the location factors, see <a href="#Area_Cost_Factor" class="MCXref xref">Location Factors</a>. Or, to take advantage of data stored in <span class="mc-variable Primary.Product variable" style="font-weight: bold;">BUILDER</span> for many locations worldwide, follow these instructions:</p>
        <ol>
            <li value="1">In the content area toolbar, activate the <span class="span_1" style="font-weight: bold;">Lookup Location</span> button.
				<p class="p_26" style="text-align: center;"><img src="inv-site-btn-lookup-location.png" alt="" /></p><p><span class="result" style="font-style: italic;">A popup will appear:</span></p><p class="p_26" style="text-align: center;"><img src="image56.png" alt="" /></p></li>
            <li value="2">In the popup, select a country.</li>
            <li value="3">If the Site is in the United States, select the state; otherwise, skip this step.</li>
            <li value="4">Select the location within the country or state where your Site is. The location list includes <MadCapconditionalText data-mc-conditions="Primary.DOD ONLY"><i>Department of Defense installations and</i> </MadCapconditionalText>most major cities in the United States.</li>
            <li value="5">If the location of your particular Site is not listed, you can select a location close to your Site.</li>
            <li value="6">Activate the <img src="../../resources/r-icons/proceed.png" alt="" /><span class="span_1"> <b>Select</b></span> (Proceed) button to automatically fill in the Location Factors data fields at your Site's <span class="span_1" style="font-weight: bold;">General Information</span> tab. 
				<p class="indent"><span class="span_1" style="font-weight: bold;">Note:</span> If instead you activate the <span class="span_1" style="font-weight: bold;">Cancel</span> button, you will return to the Site content screen without making changes. </p></li>
        </ol>
        <p>If you mark the <span class="span_1" style="font-weight: bold;">Use Location Code and Name for Site Information</span> checkbox, the location from the lookup list will be used as the name of your Site. If you leave that checkbox unmarked, your designated Site Number and Site Name will be preserved.</p>
        <p class="indent"><span class="span_1" style="font-weight: bold;">CAUTION:</span> Once you activate the <span class="span_1" style="font-weight: bold;">Use Location Code and Name for Site Information</span> checkbox , this will overwrite your Site information with that of the location you are copying factors from. If you mark the <span class="span_1" style="font-weight: bold;">Use Location Code and Name for Site Information</span> checkbox unintentionally, then you can rename your Site at the ID line in the Site content pane.</p>

They are templated or common attributes that are seen as likely to be used often. Although these attributes are made available from the outset after installing <span class="mc-variable Primary.Product variable" style="font-weight: bold;">BUILDER</span>, they still need to be assigned before they can be used to help describe an asset.</p>
