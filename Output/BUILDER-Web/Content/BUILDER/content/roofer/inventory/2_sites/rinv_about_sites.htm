        <p>A Site is the level in the asset tree that ties roofing inventory to a physical location. This topic briefly introduces the features of a Site and how to use it in organizing roofing inventory. It also provides links to the operations that can be performed at the Site level.</p>

          Your <span class="mc-variable Primary.2ndProduct variable" data-mc-conditions="Primary.Combo">ROOFER</span> inventory can contain Buildings or facilities at a number of different geographic locations (Sites). If this is the case, then multiple Sites will be needed in the inventory tree structure, one for each geographic location. Alternatively, if all Buildings or facilities to be managed (or to be gleaned for information) are in the same geographic location, one Site will usually suffice. </p>
        <h2>The Importance of Geography to the Site Level </h2>
        <p>Knowing the geographic location of a Building is extremely important; therefore it is necessary to create a Site record for each geographic location before Buildings can be added to the database. </p>
        <p>When creating a Site, keep in mind that the Site level in the hierarchy is not simply a method for subdividing inventory. It is the level where geographic factors are incorporated into <span class="mc-variable Primary.2ndProduct variable">ROOFER</span> calculations, and therefore a Site needs to be confined to a relatively limited geographic area. A larger area can be covered by an  <a href="../1_groups/rinv_about_org.htm">Organization</a> made up of multiple Sites.</p>
        <h2><a name="kanchor144"></a>Site-Level Properties</h2>
        <p>Several properties of Buildings and their roof sections are determined or affected by the Building's geographic location, most critically the <a href="javascript:void(0)" class="MCTextPopup MCTextPopupHotSpot MCTextPopup_Open glossaryTerm MCTextPopupHotSpot_" glossTerm="Primary.Term1" xmlns:MadCap="http://www.madcapsoftware.com/Schemas/MadCap.xsd">Area Cost Factor<span class="MCTextPopupBody popupBody"><span class="MCTextPopupArrow"> </span>A multiplier that adjusts national average labor/material/equipment costs to local costs. For example, in a remote area with high shipping costs and a tight labor market, the Area Cost Factor might be 1.3.  The Area Cost Factor is generally a number between 0.8 and 1.2 for continental U.S. locations, but it can be even greater than 2.0 in high-cost geographic locations.</span></a><span class="MCTextPopupBody popupBody">A multiplier that adjusts national average labor/material/equipment costs to better reflect local costs.

        <p data-mc-conditions="Primary.Builder,Primary.Split">In BUILDER, the following properties are also affected by a Building's geographic location:</p>
        <ul data-mc-conditions="Primary.Builder,Primary.Split">
            <li> HVAC zone </li>
            <li>seismic zone. </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Other factors set at the Site level are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Prioritization scheme(s).</li>
            <li>Selections for the cost book, inflation book, and service life book.</li>
