        <h1><a name="kanchor515"></a>How to Use a Building's Current Status Property</h1>
        <p>The Current Status property allows you to maintain database records for Buildings that are not currently in your physical inventory, whether for historical purposes or future planning. A Building's Current Status is used in the decision processes of both ROOFER and BUILDER, and it is the basis for a number of useful capabilities, including allowing you to enter inventory for Buildings not yet built, or inventory and inspections for Buildings not yet acquired.</p>
        <h2>Set the Current Status Property</h2>
        <!-- 1-12-2016: The following is not yet valid in ROOFER, so I substituted an extension of the last sentence of the paragraph above.
		<ul>
		<li>Define <a href="../../../Work_Management/Standards,_Policies,_and_Policy_Sequences/WM_Standards,_Policies,_and_Policy_Sequences_Overview.htm">policies</a> so that buildings scheduled for demolition are maintained at a lower standards than might generally apply. Simply use the Building Status as one of the attributes used to define a policy and assign standards as appropriate to each status type.</li>
		<li>Define work <a href="../../../Work_Management/Work_Items/Prioritization_Scheme/WM_Creating_a_Work_Prioritization_Scheme.htm">prioritization schemes</a> that consider future changes in Building Status in prioritizing work items. This can be done by using the Building Status as an initial split in your prioritization scheme and assigning weights appropriate for each status type (probably using 0.0 weight for non-current status types).</li>
		</ul>
		-->
        <p>The Current Status property is set when you <a href="rinv_add_building.htm" class="MCXref xref">Add a Building</a>. The default status in the "Add Building" popup is "Active." </p>
        <p class="indent"><span class="span_1">Note:</span> in the "Add Building" popup window, the Current Status property is labeled simply "Status."</p>
        <p>You can change this default value either by using the dropdown list of status options at the time of adding the Building, or when you <a href="rinv_edit_building_inventory_data.htm" class="MCXref xref">Edit Building General Information</a> at the Building-level <span class="span_1">General Information</span> screen. </p>
        <p>Current Status can have any one of the following values:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="span_1">Active. </span>This is the default status. Use this status for Buildings that are currently in use. This status is the end status for Buildings with status "To be built" or "To be acquired."
            </li>
            <li><span class="span_1">Vacant. </span>Use this status for Buildings that are currently in your physical inventory but not in use.
<p class="indent"><span class="span_1">Note:</span> Currently there is no way to make ROOFER treat Buildings with this status differently from "Active" Buildings.</p></li>
            <li><span class="span_1">To be transferred. </span>Use this status for Buildings that will be transferred to another owner in the future. <span class="span_9">The effective year of this status is the year in which the transfer will take place.</span> <p class="indent"><span class="span_1">Note:</span> Currently there is no way to make ROOFER treat Buildings with this status differently from "Active" Buildings.</p></li>
            <li><span class="span_1">To be demolished. </span>Use this status for Buildings that will be demolished in the future. <span class="span_9">The effective year of this status is the year in which the Building is to be demolished.</span> <p class="indent"><span class="span_1">Note:</span> In the future it may be possible to assign lower prioritization to work items associated with a Building having this status, but currently there is no way to make ROOFER treat Buildings with this status differently from "Active" Buildings.</p></li>
            <li><span class="span_1">To be acquired. </span>Use this status to enter inventory records for an existing Building prior to its acquisition. <span class="span_9">The effective year of this status is the year in which the Building is expected to be acquired.</span> <p>You will be able to edit the Building and inspection data for this type of Building, and ROOFER's condition and remaining service life predictions will be applied based on the inspection data entered. In this way, you will be able to estimate the maintenance requirements of such a Building prior to its acquisition. For more information, see <a href="#%22To" class="MCXref xref">"To Be Acquired"</a><MadCap:conditionalText data-mc-conditions="Primary.ScreenOnly"> below</MadCap:conditionalText>.</p></li>
            <li><span class="span_1">To be built. </span>Use this status to enter inventory records for a new Building prior to its commissioning for occupancy. <span class="span_9">The effective year of this status is the year in which the Building is expected to be recognized as part of your physical inventory</span>. <p>In ROOFER, you will be able to edit the Building data on the Building Summary screen but will not be able to add inspection records until the Current Status changes to "Active." For more information, see <a href="#%22To2" class="MCXref xref">"To Be Built"</a> below.<!-- In a Scenario simulation, this feature allows you to add new Buildings dynamically as the simulation progresses.--></p></li>
            <li><span class="span_1">Transferred. </span>Use this status to force ROOFER's automated processes for condition/service life assessment and work planning to skip the Building but leave the inventory and inspection records intact. <span class="span_9">The effective year for this status is the year in which the transfer takes place.</span> "Transferred" the end status of the "To be transferred" status.
For more information, see <a href="#Keep" class="MCXref xref">Keep Records of Past Buildings (Demolished, Transferred)</a> below.        </li>
            <li><span class="span_1">Demolished. </span>Use this status to remove a Building from ROOFER's automated processes for condition/service life assessment and work planning but leave the inventory and inspection records intact. <span class="span_9">The effective year for this status is the year in which the Building is demolished.</span> "Demolished" is the end status of the "To be demolished" status.

        </ul>
        <h3>Review of Current Status Options:</h3>
        <p>The last four of these values indicate that the designated Building is not currently part of the inventory, and two others ("To be transferred" and "To be demolished") indicate that the Building will be removed from the inventory in the future. In essence, one of the things that the Current Status property allows you to do is to enter future Buildings into the inventory and to plan for their maintenance <!-- in Scenarios--> even though they are not presently owned. In addition, the Current Status property allows you to keep records for Buildings that are no longer in the physical inventory. Such records are ignored in processes that should only consider current Buildings, such as condition rollups and work planning.</p>
        <p>Currently <span class="mc-variable Primary.2ndProduct variable">ROOFER</span> treats the "Active" and "Vacant" status options in the same way.</p>
        <hr width="100%" size="0" align="center" />
        <p>The following sections provide tips on how current status property settings other than "Active" can be profitably used to avoid losing records and to track non-current inventory.</p>
        <hr width="100%" size="0" align="center" />
        <h2>Use the Current Status Property to Avoid Losing Records</h2>
        <p>When you <a href="../../../inventory/buildings/inv_deleting_a_building.htm"><a href="rinv_delete_building.htm" class="MCXref xref">Delete a Building</a></a> from ROOFER, this removes all database records associated with that Building. If you wish to keep the records, whether for historical purposes, analysis, or possible transfer to another ROOFER database (perhaps the Building is being transferred from one property book to another), you should simply set the Current Status property to an appropriate value instead, such as "Transferred" or "Demolished."</p>
        <h2>Add Future Buildings</h2>
        <p>Using the Current Status property, it is possible to enter Buildings into the database before they are actually in the physical inventory. This includes Buildings under construction (designated with status "To be built") and existing Buildings being considered for acquisition from another owner (designated with status "To be acquired"). </p>
        <h3><a name="&quot;To"></a>"To Be Acquired"</h3>
        <p>By setting the Current Status property to "To be acquired" and entering data in advance, you will be able to anticipate short-term work requirements for existing Buildings about to be acquired<!-- builder only: and to plan long-term maintenance requirements for future Buildings using Scenarios-->.</p>
        <h4>Enter Inventory Records</h4>
        <p>Use this status to enter inventory records for a new Building prior to its acquisition. </p>
        <h4>Record Inspection Results</h4>
        <p>Once you have entered inventory records for a Building with status "To be acquired," you may record inspection results prior to acquisition. The <span class="mc-variable Primary.2ndProduct variable">ROOFER</span> processes that determine remaining service life and condition prediction will track the condition of the Building's roof section after the Building is first entered and prior to its acquisition. </p>
        <h4>Generate a Work Plan</h4>
        <p>With inspection results, <span class="mc-variable Primary.2ndProduct variable">ROOFER</span> will be able to generate a work plan for the Building to upgrade its roofing to your established standards. Such information could be invaluable in planning for the load such a Building will place on both short and long term budgets.</p>
        <h3><a name="&quot;To2"></a>"To Be Built"</h3>
        <h4>Enter Inventory Records</h4>
        <p>Use this status to enter inventory records for a new Building prior to its commissioning for occupancy.</p>
        <h4>No Recording of Inspection Results</h4>
        <p>If you enter a Building with status "To be built," you may not record new inspections until the status changes to "Active." The <span class="mc-variable Primary.2ndProduct variable">ROOFER</span> processes that determine remaining service life and condition prediction will skip such a Building under the assumption that quality assurance during the construction process will force all roof sections to an <a href="javascript:void(0)" class="MCTextPopup MCTextPopupHotSpot MCTextPopup_Open MCTextPopupHotSpot_ #text">RCI<img class="MCHelpControl_Image_Icon" src="../../../../Skins/Default/Stylesheets/Images/transparent_16x11.gif" alt="Closed" data-mc-alt2="Open" style="width: 16;height: 11;" /><span class="MCTextPopupBody popupBody"><span class="MCTextPopupArrow"> </span>Roof Condition Index</span></a> of 100 prior to commissioning. </p>
        <h4 data-mc-conditions="Primary.Builder">Use Scenarios to Simulate "Active" Status</h4>
        <p data-mc-conditions="Primary.Builder">The advantage of entering the Building before it is built is that you may include it in Scenarios to measure its long-term effects on work plans and budgets That is, the scenario can change the status of a new Building to "Active" at a scheduled time and begin treating it as a normal Building with predictable deterioration rates and work requirements.</p>

        <h2><a name="Keep"></a>Keep Records of Past Buildings (Demolished, Transferred)</h2>
        <p>In earlier versions of <span class="mc-variable Primary.2ndProduct variable">ROOFER</span>, the only way to eliminate a Building from the automated assessment and planning processes used by <span class="mc-variable Primary.2ndProduct variable">ROOFER</span> was to <a href="rinv_delete_building.htm">delete the Building</a>. With this approach, all records related to the Building were actually deleted from the database. </p>
        <p>Now, the Current Status property gives you another option. </p>
        <p>If you have records in the <span class="mc-variable Primary.2ndProduct variable">ROOFER</span> database for a Building which is to be demolished or transferred to another owner, you can keep the inventory, inspection, and work history records in the <span class="mc-variable Primary.2ndProduct variable">ROOFER</span> database, while at the same time making the Building invisible to <span class="mc-variable Primary.2ndProduct variable">ROOFER</span>’s automated processes, simply by changing the Building's status to "Demolished" or "Transferred."</p>
        <p class="indent"><span class="span_1">Best Practice Recommendation:</span> When you delete a Building, you actually remove all database records associated with that Building. If you wish to keep the records, whether for historical purposes, analysis, or possible transfer to another <span class="mc-variable Primary.2ndProduct variable">ROOFER</span> database (perhaps the Building is being transferred from one property book to another), then you should simply set the Current Status property to the appropriate value, either "Demolished" or "Transferred."</p>
        <p>Below is a summary of what happens when a Building has the status of either "Demolished" or "Transferred": </p>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="span_1">Inventory records are locked.</span> You will be unable to change the Building's data properties or its composition.</li>

                </MadCap:conditionalText><span class="span_1">records are locked.</span> You will be unable to change existing records or to add new records. </li>
            <li><span class="span_1">Work Planning records are locked.</span> You will be unable to change existing records or to add new records. </li>
            <li><span class="span_1">Cost data is not updated.</span> The Building's cost data will not be affected by annual cost updates at the beginning of the calendar year. </li>
            <li><span class="span_1">The Building will not be considered during automatic work generation. </span>
            </li>
            <li data-mc-conditions="Primary.Builder,Primary.Split"><span class="span_1">The Building will not appear in Scenarios simulations. </span> </li>
            <li data-mc-conditions="Primary.Builder,Primary.Split">If the Building's status is changed to "Demolished" or "Transferred" during a Scenarios simulation, it will have records for the years prior to its status change and then after that date in the scenario, it will be treated as above. That is, there will be no further updates of data, no new inspections, no changes in condition or service life, etc. </li>
