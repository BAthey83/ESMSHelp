        <h1><a name="kanchor834"></a>Edit Building General Information</h1>
        <p>The sections below, as well as the topic <a href="rinv_edit_additional_building_data.htm" class="MCXref xref">Edit Additional Building Inventory Data</a>, describe information that can be obtained about and actions that can be performed on the Building.</p>
        <p>To view and edit Building inventory data, select the Building in the navigation pane.</p>
        <p class="p_26" style="text-align: center;">
            <img src="r-edit-bldg-info-3_3_850x435.png" alt="" style="width: 850;height: 435;" />
        </p>
        <h3><span class="span_1">Toolbar</span>
        </h3>
        <p>The following buttons and information are available at the content screen toolbar:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="span_1">Save</span>. Saves changes made to the Building data.</li>
            <li><span class="span_1">Comment</span>. Allows you to add, edit, and view comments about the Building.</li>
            <li><span class="span_1">Reports</span>. Launches the Report Selection tool, which gives you access to a list of standard reports relevant to Building inventory. See <a href="../../../tools/reports/tools_using_the_report_viewer.htm"><a href="../../../tools/reports/tools_using_the_report_viewer.htm" class="MCXref xref">How to Use the Report Viewer</a></a>.</li>
            <li><span class="span_1">Breadcrumbs</span>. The breadcrumbs shown on the toolbar provide both orientation and an alternative method of navigation:<p class="p_26" style="text-align: center;"><img src="../5_roof sections/breadcrumbs-bldg-sample-3_3.png" alt="" /></p></li>
        </ul>
        <h3>ID Line</h3>
        <p>On the ID line, you can edit the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="span_1">Building ID Number.</span> The ID Number is limited to 12 alphanumeric characters. <![CDATA[            ]]></li>
            <li><span class="span_1">Building Name.</span> 
Building Name is allowed 50 characters. For additional specifications, refer to <a href="../../../inventory/buildings/inv_adding_a_building.htm#Enter" class="MCXref xref">Enter Required Building Information</a>.<![CDATA[      ]]></li>
        </ul>
        <h2>General Building Information - General Info. Tab</h2>
        <p>Initially after a Building is selected in the inventory tree, the <span class="span_1">General Information</span> tab (abbreviated <span class="span_1">General Info.</span>) is shown with the following information, all of which is required:</p>
        <h3>Type, Age, and Size Data</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="span_1"><a name="kanchor835"></a>Building Use.</span> From the dropdown list, select the Building Use category that most closely matches the Building's use. For a Department of Defense activity, ROOFER should display familiar category codes for your service.</li>
            <li><span class="span_1">Current Status.</span> From the dropdown list, select the appropriate Building status. See <a href="../../../inventory/buildings/inv_about_the_building_status_property.htm"><a href="rinv_using_the_building_status_property.htm" class="MCXref xref">How to Use a Building's Current Status Property</a></a> for more information. Status type options include:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Active</li>
                <li>Vacant</li>
                <li>To be transferred</li>
                <li>To be demolished</li>
                <li>To be acquired</li>
                <li>To be built</li>
                <li>Transferred</li>
                <li>Demolished</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The options "To be acquired" and "To be built" allow you to enter future Buildings into the inventory and to plan for their maintenance in Scenarios even though they are not presently owned. Along with Transferred and Demolished, these options allow you to keep information about the Building in your database without the data on these Buildings affecting your current condition indexes.</p>
            <p>The options "Transferred" and "Demolished" allow you to keep records for Buildings that are no longer in the physical inventory. Such records are ignored in processes that should only consider current Buildings, such as condition rollups and work planning.</p>
            <li><span class="span_1">Effective Year of Status. </span>When you choose a Building status other than the default "Active" status, you must also provide a year in which the permanent status will take effect. For vacant, demolished, and transferred Buildings, the effective year is the year the action occurred. For future "To be" statuses, the effective year is the year the future event will occur, i.e. the year the Building will be actually built, acquired, transferred, or demolished.</li>
            <li><a name="kanchor836"></a><span class="span_1">Construction Type.</span>  Select the construction type from the dropdown list that matches the Building. Construction type options include:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Permanent</li>
                <li>Semi-Permanent</li>
                <li>Temporary</li>
                <li>Leased</li>
            </ul>
            <li><span class="span_1">Area.</span> Enter the gross area of the Building.</li>
            <li><span class="span_1">Year Constructed.</span> Enter the year that construction of the Building was completed. This data element determines the age of the Building, which is a critical factor in ROOFER's decision-making processes.</li>
            <li><span class="span_1">Number of Floors.</span> Enter the number of floors of the Building. This data element is used to estimate the size of the Building's footprint by dividing the area by the number of floors.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Calculated Data</h3>
        <p>Data calculated by ROOFER is usually read-only. However, <span class="span_1">Replacement Cost</span> and <span class="span_1">Mission Dependency Index (<a href="javascript:void(0)" class="MCTextPopup MCTextPopupHotSpot MCTextPopup_Open glossaryTerm glossaryTermPopup MCTextPopupHotSpot_ MCTextPopupHotSpot_Popup" glossTerm="ESMS-gloss.Term3" xmlns:MadCap="http://www.madcapsoftware.com/Schemas/MadCap.xsd">MDI<span class="MCTextPopupBody popupBody"><span class="MCTextPopupArrow"> </span>Mission Dependency Index - measures the relative importance of a Building</span></a><span class="MCTextPopupBody popupBody">Mission Dependency Index - measures the relative importance of a Building</span>)</span> each have a checkbox that allows manual entry or manual override of the system-calculated figure.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="span_1"><a name="kanchor837"></a><a name="kanchor838"></a>Replacement Cost. </span>This data element contains the current replacement cost for a Building of the current Building's use and size under current construction standards. ROOFER provides a cost module to estimate the replacement cost. If you do not check the manual override checkbox, the cost module will update the replacement cost using the default <a href="../../../tools/library/cost-ref-about.htm">cost book</a>, adjusted for <a href="../../../tools/library/tools_viewing_and_editing_inflation_rates.htm">inflation</a> and geographic location, when costs are updated. If you check the manual override checkbox, the cost module will not affect this Building's replacement cost, and you will have to periodically update its replacement cost manually to account for inflation.</li>
            <li><span class="span_1">Mission Dependency Index.</span><a name="kanchor839"></a><a name="kanchor840"></a>The availability of the Mission Dependency Index (<a href="javascript:void(0)" class="MCTextPopup MCTextPopupHotSpot MCTextPopup_Open glossaryTerm glossaryTermPopup MCTextPopupHotSpot_ MCTextPopupHotSpot_Popup" glossTerm="ESMS-gloss.Term3" xmlns:MadCap="http://www.madcapsoftware.com/Schemas/MadCap.xsd">MDI<span class="MCTextPopupBody popupBody"><span class="MCTextPopupArrow"> </span>Mission Dependency Index - measures the relative importance of a Building</span></a><span class="MCTextPopupBody popupBody">Mission Dependency Index - measures the relative importance of a Building</span>) is the result of ongoing U.S. Navy research to develop a process for computing a 0-100 index that measures how critical the facility is to the overall mission of its owner. This measure allows user input to shape an automated planning process that uses metrics and rules to identify and prioritize budget allocations and work plans.
