        <p>Your <MadCap:conditionalText data-mc-conditions="Primary.Roofer">ROOFER </MadCap:conditionalText>inventory serves as the foundation for all that you will do with the <MadCap:conditionalText data-mc-conditions="Primary.Roofer">ROOFER </MadCap:conditionalText>application. Therefore, it pays to make sure that your inventory process is well planned and thorough.</p>
        <h2>Step 1: Plan the Inventory Tree</h2>
        <h4>Scope and Structure of the Inventory Tree</h4>
        <p>The first step in the inventory process, if you are implementing ROOFER for the first time, is to determine the scope and structure of the information tree that describes the physical inventory you manage. The section <a href="../../inventory/rinv_plan_inventory_tree.htm" class="MCXref xref">Plan the Inventory Tree</a> provides some guidance for this step. </p>
        <h4>Hierarchical Levels</h4>
        <p>In order to either plan or manage the tree effectively, you should first be familiar with the hierarchical levels used for storing inventory data; these levels are described in <a href="../getting_started/roofer_hierarchy_overview.htm" class="MCXref xref">Understanding ROOFER Inventory Hierarchy
</a></p>
        <h2>Step 2: Edit Application Settings</h2>
        <p class="indent"><span class="span_1">Note:</span> This step, as well as the step of assigning user Roles, will require participation of someone with the <a href="javascript:void(0)" class="MCTextPopup MCTextPopupHotSpot MCTextPopup_Open MCTextPopupHotSpot_ #text">Administrator<img class="MCHelpControl_Image_Icon" src="../../../Skins/Default/Stylesheets/Images/transparent_16x11.gif" alt="Closed" data-mc-alt2="Open" style="width: 16;height: 11;" /><span class="MCTextPopupBody popupBody"><span class="MCTextPopupArrow"> </span>A user with BUILDER or ROOFER Administrator Role can administer users, assign users to Roles, and change software configuration settings.</span></a> permissions Role setting.</p>
        <p>Before records are created in the inventory tree, someone with ROOFER <a href="javascript:void(0)" class="MCTextPopup MCTextPopupHotSpot MCTextPopup_Open MCTextPopupHotSpot_ #text">Administrator<img class="MCHelpControl_Image_Icon" src="../../../Skins/Default/Stylesheets/Images/transparent_16x11.gif" alt="Closed" data-mc-alt2="Open" style="width: 16;height: 11;" /><span class="MCTextPopupBody popupBody"><span class="MCTextPopupArrow"> </span>A user with BUILDER or ROOFER Administrator Role can administer users, assign users to Roles, and change software configuration settings.</span></a> privileges must set preferences for the <a href="../rtools/rtooladministration/rtools_application_settings.htm">application settings</a>. To edit the application settings, select <span class="span_1">Tools &gt; Administration &gt; Application Settings</span> starting at the main menu.</p>
        <p>Descriptions of the application settings are in the <a href="../rtools/rtooladministration/rtools_application_settings.htm" class="MCXref xref">Manage ROOFER Application Settings</a> topic.</p>
        <h2>Step 3: Assign User Roles</h2>
        <p class="indent"><span class="span_1">Note:</span> This step, as well as the step of editing application settings, will require participation of someone with the <a href="javascript:void(0)" class="MCTextPopup MCTextPopupHotSpot MCTextPopup_Open MCTextPopupHotSpot_ #text">Administrator<img class="MCHelpControl_Image_Icon" src="../../../Skins/Default/Stylesheets/Images/transparent_16x11.gif" alt="Closed" data-mc-alt2="Open" style="width: 16;height: 11;" /><span class="MCTextPopupBody popupBody"><span class="MCTextPopupArrow"> </span>A user with BUILDER or ROOFER Administrator Role can administer users, assign users to Roles, and change software configuration settings.</span></a> permissions Role setting.</p>
        <p>At higher levels of the inventory tree, the Add and Edit operations are restricted to users with a particular minimum level of permissions. For example, only an <a href="javascript:void(0)" class="MCTextPopup MCTextPopupHotSpot MCTextPopup_Open MCTextPopupHotSpot_ #text">Administrator<img class="MCHelpControl_Image_Icon" src="../../../Skins/Default/Stylesheets/Images/transparent_16x11.gif" alt="Closed" data-mc-alt2="Open" style="width: 16;height: 11;" /><span class="MCTextPopupBody popupBody"><span class="MCTextPopupArrow"> </span>A user with BUILDER or ROOFER Administrator Role can administer users, assign users to Roles, and change software configuration settings.</span></a> can delete an Organization, Site, or Complex. Because of this security feature, it is a good idea to gain advance familiarity with <span class="mc-variable Primary.2ndProduct variable">ROOFER</span> permissions Roles (see <a href="../getting_started/rpermissions_roles.htm" class="MCXref xref">Overview of ROOFER Permissions Roles</a>) and decide who should be assigned which user Roles before proceeding to the next step, <a href="#Create">Create Records</a>.</p>
        <p>Once you have decided which users are to be assigned what Roles, this can be implemented by someone with <a href="javascript:void(0)" class="MCTextPopup MCTextPopupHotSpot MCTextPopup_Open MCTextPopupHotSpot_ #text">Administrator<img class="MCHelpControl_Image_Icon" src="../../../Skins/Default/Stylesheets/Images/transparent_16x11.gif" alt="Closed" data-mc-alt2="Open" style="width: 16;height: 11;" /><span class="MCTextPopupBody popupBody"><span class="MCTextPopupArrow"> </span>A user with BUILDER or ROOFER Administrator Role can administer users, assign users to Roles, and change software configuration settings.</span></a> permissions level.</p>
        <h2><a name="Create"></a>Step 4: Create Records</h2>
        <h3>Transferring Records from Existing Software</h3>
        <p>It's possible that inventory data may already exist in an asset management program. In this case, contact your ROOFER support representative for advice on how to transfer records int ROOFER .</p>
        <h3>Creating New Records</h3>
        <p>The records for the upper levels of the inventory tree (Organization and Site) need to be created by someone with the <a href="javascript:void(0)" class="MCTextPopup MCTextPopupHotSpot MCTextPopup_Open MCTextPopupHotSpot_ #text">Master Planner<img class="MCHelpControl_Image_Icon" src="../../../Skins/Default/Stylesheets/Images/transparent_16x11.gif" alt="Closed" data-mc-alt2="Open" style="width: 16;height: 11;" /><span class="MCTextPopupBody popupBody"><span class="MCTextPopupArrow"> </span>A user with Master Planner Role has all the rights of a Work Planners, and can also generate multi-year work plan scenarios, and edit any and all data saved by other users of the program. Master Planner is the highest level of user privileges.</span></a> level of permissions. After these upper-level records are created, they may be edited by users with lower permissions Roles.</p>
        <p>After the upper levels of the inventory tree have been established and entered, the next step is to <a href="4_buildings/rinv_add_building.htm"><a href="4_buildings/rinv_add_building.htm">create Building records</a></a> for the Buildings at your Site or one of your Sites. A Building record includes critical information such as how the building or facility is used, and its size, age, and number of floors. <!-- ajf-check: I think MDI is BUILDER only? You will also be able to establish a <a href="../../Tools/MDI/TOOLS_Mission_Dependency_Index_Overview.htm">mission dependency index</a> to measure quantitatively how critical the building is to the mission for which it is used.--></p>
        <p class="indent"><span class="span_1">Note:</span> Only after at least one of its constituent Buildings has been created may a Complex be created, if desired.</p>
        <p>After you have created a Building record in the <span class="mc-variable Primary.2ndProduct variable">ROOFER</span> inventory, you will be able to add records that describe the roof sections. Inspections are done on the sections; then <span class="mc-variable Primary.2ndProduct variable">ROOFER</span> applies its condition assessment algorithms to calculate condition indexes for the sections and prioritizes needed replacements and/or repairs for work planning. </p>
        <h2>Step 5: Collect Inventory Data </h2>
        <p>Next comes the process of collecting detailed information about your roofing inventory. This effort may be done by existing staff, or may be contracted out. </p>
        <p>The process of putting this data into <span class="mc-variable Primary.2ndProduct variable">ROOFER</span> will probably be your single most intensive effort in working with the program, but for the most part it this a one-time effort. </p>
        <p class="indent"><span class="span_1">Note:</span> If both BUILDER and ROOFER are being used, the upper inventory levels are common to both tools. However, the data pertaining to inventory inhabiting these levels is not currently shared between the two software applications. </p>
        <!--
        <p>orig</p>
        <p>ROOFER uses embedded data and automated processes to determine a wealth of information about each roof section: its expected service life, its sub-components and how their condition affects the roof section as a whole, and the cost of replacing, repairing, or removing the section. As you might imagine, for an automated system to be able to do all of this, there are some strict rules about how you define roof sections. </p>
-->
        <p>
