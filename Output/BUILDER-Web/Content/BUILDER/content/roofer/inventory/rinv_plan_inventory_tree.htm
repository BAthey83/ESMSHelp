        <p>This topic addresses the need to carefully plan, in advance, the scope and structure of the hierarchical asset tree that will organize your inventory and allow you to access it at differing levels of detail. Typically you will be using the information in this topic as you initiate the information-gathering phase of using the ROOFER <a href="javascript:void(0)" class="MCTextPopup MCTextPopupHotSpot MCTextPopup_Open glossaryTerm glossaryTermPopup MCTextPopupHotSpot_ MCTextPopupHotSpot_Popup" glossTerm="Primary.Term0">SMS<img class="MCHelpControl_Image_Icon" src="../../../Skins/Default/Stylesheets/Images/transparent_16x11.gif" alt="Closed" data-mc-alt2="Open" style="width: 16;height: 11;" /><span class="MCTextPopupBody popupBody"><span class="MCTextPopupArrow"> </span>Sustainment Management System</span></a> module. </p>

        </p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>The first step in the inventory process, if you are implementing ROOFER for the first time, is to determine the scope and structure of the information tree that describes the physical inventory you manage, called the <span class="span_9">inventory tree</span>. If you will be using contractors for the project of entering inventory data, you must still plan out and create the inventory tree, at least at the upper levels (Site and above) before data concerning your roofing inventory is entered.</p>
        <p>Inventory tree creation in <span class="mc-variable Primary.2ndProduct variable">ROOFER</span> takes place from the top down, starting under the root note either with one or more Organizations, if applicable, or starting with one or more Sites. However, conceptually, the initial design can be sketched out using either top-down or bottom-up thinking, as outlined in sections below.</p>
        <p class="indent"><span class="span_1">Note:</span> In order to plan the inventory tree effectively, you should first be familiar with the hierarchical levels used for storing inventory data. These levels are described in <a href="../getting_started/roofer_hierarchy_overview.htm" class="MCXref xref">Understanding ROOFER Inventory Hierarchy
</a></p>
        <h2><a name="Top-Down"></a>Top-Down Tree Planning</h2>
        <h3>Organization</h3>
        <p>Although the Site is the lowest level node that can function as the root for an inventory tree in the <a href="javascript:void(0)" class="MCTextPopup MCTextPopupHotSpot MCTextPopup_Open glossaryTerm glossaryTermPopup MCTextPopupHotSpot_ MCTextPopupHotSpot_Popup" glossTerm="Primary.Term0">SMS<img class="MCHelpControl_Image_Icon" src="../../../Skins/Default/Stylesheets/Images/transparent_16x11.gif" alt="Closed" data-mc-alt2="Open" style="width: 16;height: 11;" /><span class="MCTextPopupBody popupBody"><span class="MCTextPopupArrow"> </span>Sustainment Management System</span></a>, and <span class="mc-variable Primary.2ndProduct variable">ROOFER</span> is typically used at the individual Site or installation level to track roof inventory and plan work,  there may be reasons to incorporate higher levels (Organization) of the <a href="../getting_started/roofer_hierarchy_overview.htm" data-mc-conditions="Primary.Roofer"><a href="javascript:void(0)" class="MCTextPopup MCTextPopupHotSpot MCTextPopup_Open glossaryTerm glossaryTermPopup MCTextPopupHotSpot_ MCTextPopupHotSpot_Popup" glossTerm="Primary.Term0">SMS<img class="MCHelpControl_Image_Icon" src="../../../Skins/Default/Stylesheets/Images/transparent_16x11.gif" alt="Closed" data-mc-alt2="Open" style="width: 16;height: 11;" /><span class="MCTextPopupBody popupBody"><span class="MCTextPopupArrow"> </span>Sustainment Management System</span></a> hierarchy</a>  in your <span class="mc-variable Primary.2ndProduct variable">ROOFER</span> inventory tree. For example, if you are also using the BUILDER <a href="javascript:void(0)" class="MCTextPopup MCTextPopupHotSpot MCTextPopup_Open MCTextPopupHotSpot_ MCTextPopupHotSpot_Popup #text #textPopup">SMS<img class="MCHelpControl_Image_Icon" src="../../../Skins/Default/Stylesheets/Images/transparent_16x11.gif" alt="Closed" data-mc-alt2="Open" style="width: 16;height: 11;" /><span class="MCTextPopupBody popupBody"><span class="MCTextPopupArrow"> </span>Sustainment Management System</span></a> module, then you might want to reflect all levels present in your BUILDER , in order to harmonize the two modules.</p>
        <p class="indent"><span class="span_1">IMPORTANT:</span> Because the ROOFER navigational structure can be added to only from the top down, if you are introducing ROOFER for the first time and creating the tree structure for your real property data, it is imperative to analyze in advance the final scope anticipated for entry and management of properties, and to create the Organization levels that will be needed in the long run even if they will not be filled with content in the short run. </p>
        <p class="indent"><span class="span_1">WARNING:</span> If you end up needing to create an organizational level above the highest level that you have, this will require custom work on the part of your ROOFER support representative. </p>
        <p class="indent"><span class="span_1">Best Practice Recommendation:</span> When designing and building your organizational tree in <span class="mc-variable Primary.2ndProduct variable">ROOFER</span>, best practice is to err on the side of too many rather than too few levels of nested Organizations.</p>
        <p>The most important thing in planning the inventory tree is to be forward thinking and to accommodate from the outset the very highest organizational level you think you may need in the future. At the same time, you must also make sure that at the top of the hierarchical structure you have a single node that can act as the "root" of the inventory tree; because of this, you may need to make one additional, higher hierarchical level above your top organizational level if the top level has or may come to have more than one Organization (or Site) in it.</p>
        <p>It is not necessary to enter at the beginning all members of each hierarchical level, especially if it is uncertain whether the upper levels will be needed in the future. One entry per hierarchical level is the mandatory minimum, and enough to reserve that level for future use.</p>
        <h3>Site</h3>
        <p>At least one Site is required in your ROOFER implementation. A Site serves to group Buildings in the ROOFER database by geographic region and enables you to apply properties that are regional in nature, such as climate or the cost of operations and maintenance (O&amp;M) work.</p>
        <h3>Complex (Optional)</h3>
        <p>Optionally, Buildings (the next level down from Complex) can be clustered into Complexes for management purposes, especially those with similar use and/or similar construction. However, this is not done until <span class="span_9">after</span> a Building is created in a Site (next level up from Complex).</p>
        <p>Therefore, although a Complex can be planned conceptually before its constituent Buildings are planned, <span class="span_9">implementation</span> of a Complex does not take place until after the Buildings are created.</p>
        <h3>Building</h3>
        <p>Individual structures at a Site are represented by the Building level in the ROOFER hierarchy.</p>
        <h3>Roof Section</h3>
        <!-- <p>After you have created a Building record in the ROOFER inventory, you will be able to add records that describe the roof sections. </p> -->
        <p>The roof section is the lowest level in the <span class="mc-variable Primary.2ndProduct variable">ROOFER</span> hierarchy. Difference in age, material, or even (more rarely) compass direction call for a separate roof section to be created in the inventory.</p>
        <p>In practice, inspections are done on the sections; then ROOFER applies its condition assessment algorithms to calculate condition indexes for the sections and prioritizes needed replacements and repairs for work planning.</p>
        <h2>Bottom-Up Tree Planning</h2>
        <h3>Roof Section</h3>
        <p>The lowest level in the <span class="mc-variable Primary.2ndProduct variable">ROOFER</span> hierarchy is the roof section. Difference in age, material, or even (more rarely) compass direction call for a separate roof section to be created in the inventory.</p>
        <h3>Building</h3>
        <p>The association between roof sections and the Building they are on is obvious. the Building is the next level up in the hierarchy.</p>
        <h3>Complex (Optional)</h3>
        <p>Optionally, Buildings in ROOFER can be clustered into Complexes for management purposes, especially those with similar use and/or similar construction. However, this is not done until after a Building is created in a Site (next level up).</p>
        <h3>Site</h3>
        <p>Before implementing any collection of them into Complexes (optional), your Buildings should be grouped by geographic region, which are represented by Site records in the <span class="mc-variable Primary.2ndProduct variable">ROOFER</span> database. The Site hierarchical level provides a natural way to group Buildings and to apply properties that are regional in nature, such as climate or the cost of operations and maintenance (O&amp;M) work.</p>
        <h3>Organization (Optional)</h3>
        <p>Finally, the Sites can be grouped into logical management units called Organizations. Organizations are unique in the ROOFER hierarchy in that they can be nested multiple levels deep if desired. Note, however, that this flexibility brings with it the responsibility for careful planning. For more detail, refer to the "Organization" section under <a href="#Top-Down" class="MCXref xref">Top-Down Tree Planning</a> above.</p>
