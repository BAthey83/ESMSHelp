        <h2>First Time Implementation</h2>
        <p>If you are implementing ROOFER for the first time in your company or organization, then after you have read the Getting Started with ROOFER chapter and familiarized yourself with this Inventory Overview, you  should study the chapter on how to <a href="rINV_Inventory_Steps.htm">plan and implement initial ROOFER inventory</a>. Because your ROOFER inventory serves as the foundation for all that will be done with the ROOFER application, it pays to make sure that the inventory process is well planned and thorough.</p>
-->
        <p>There are two primary stages in using <span class="mc-variable Primary.2ndProduct variable">ROOFER</span>™: </p>
        <ol>
            <li value="1">Inventory stage</li>
            <li value="2"> Maintenance stage.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Entering roofing inventory and other associated elements into <span class="mc-variable Primary.2ndProduct variable">ROOFER</span> is the sole focus of the first stage. During the second stage, inventory tasks will still be performed, for example when:</p>
        <ul>
            <li> Information entered during initial inventory needs to be revised.</li>
            <li>
 				Roof sections are repaired or replaced.</li>
            <li>Additional inventory is added.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>The Goal of Inventory</h2>
        <h3>During the Inventory Stage</h3>
        <p>The goal of the inventory stage is to catalog a roofing portfolio in such a way as to produce, in <span class="mc-variable Primary.2ndProduct variable">ROOFER</span>, a completed, hierarchical inventory tree where information about each roof section is placed into a manageable, organized structure that is recognizable by the <span class="mc-variable Primary.2ndProduct variable">ROOFER</span> program. Once this has been done, then <span class="mc-variable Primary.2ndProduct variable">ROOFER</span> can use the information to create valuable outputs for decision making.</p>
        <h3>During the Maintenance Stage</h3>
        <p>During the maintenance stage of using <span class="mc-variable Primary.2ndProduct variable">ROOFER</span>, the goal of inventory is to keep the inventory current by recording additions to the inventory; roof section repair dates, and roof section replacements, and to upgrade the completeness of inventory properties entered into <span class="mc-variable Primary.2ndProduct variable">ROOFER</span> as needed.</p>
        <h2>About User Roles</h2>
        <p>After the higher levels of the inventory tree have been established, inventory entry and editing can be done either by someone with a user permissions role limited to those functions useful to the inventory process, or by someone with higher permissions. The Role that is limited to basic inventory procedures is called "<a href="javascript:void(0)" class="MCTextPopup MCTextPopupHotSpot MCTextPopup_Open glossaryTerm MCTextPopupHotSpot_" glossTerm="Primary.Term7" xmlns:MadCap="http://www.madcapsoftware.com/Schemas/MadCap.xsd">Inventorior<span class="MCTextPopupBody popupBody"><span class="MCTextPopupArrow"> </span>A user with Inventorior Role can add and edit records below the Building level.</span></a><span class="MCTextPopupBody popupBody">A user with Inventorior Role can add and edit records below the Building level.</span>."

        <p>User permissions Roles are explained in more detail in <a href="../getting_started/rpermissions_roles.htm" class="MCXref xref">Overview of ROOFER Permissions Roles</a></p>
        <h2>User Activities</h2>
        <p>Activities that an <a href="javascript:void(0)" class="MCTextPopup MCTextPopupHotSpot MCTextPopup_Open glossaryTerm MCTextPopupHotSpot_" glossTerm="Primary.Term7" xmlns:MadCap="http://www.madcapsoftware.com/Schemas/MadCap.xsd">Inventorior<span class="MCTextPopupBody popupBody"><span class="MCTextPopupArrow"> </span>A user with Inventorior Role can add and edit records below the Building level.</span></a><span class="MCTextPopupBody popupBody">A user with Inventorior Role can add and edit records below the Building level.</span> will perform are adding records at the Building and roof section levels; adding one or more Complexes, if desired, and moving Building records under the Complex; and editing and updating information in Building and roof section records. It is possible that transfer of real property record information from an existing asset management database will be involved.</p>

        <!--
        <p>orig</p>
        <p>ROOFER uses embedded data and automated processes to determine a wealth of information about each roof section: its expected service life, its sub-components and how their condition affects the roof section as a whole, and the cost of replacing, repairing, or removing the section. As you might imagine, for an automated system to be able to do all of this, there are some strict rules about how you define roof sections. </p>
