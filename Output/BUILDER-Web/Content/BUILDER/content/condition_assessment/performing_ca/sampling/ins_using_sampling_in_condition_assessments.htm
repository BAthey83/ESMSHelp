        <h1><a name="kanchor194"></a>How To Prepare for Sampling</h1>
        <hr width="100%" size="0" align="center" />
        <p>If an entire Component-Section is not readily viewable–whether due to its size (quantity), complexity, inaccessibility, or other reasons–sampling can be used to cut down the workload or to estimate the condition of an entire Component-Section based on the condition of accessible parts. This topic introduces how to prepare for sampling.</p>
        <p>The information in this topic is adapted and rearranged from Section 2.9 of ERDC/CERL <a href="javascript:void(0)" class="MCTextPopup MCTextPopupHotSpot MCTextPopup_Open glossaryTerm glossaryTermPopup MCTextPopupHotSpot_ MCTextPopupHotSpot_Popup" glossTerm="Primary.Term20" xmlns:MadCap="http://www.madcapsoftware.com/Schemas/MadCap.xsd">SR<span class="MCTextPopupBody popupBody"><span class="MCTextPopupArrow"> </span>Shingle Roofing</span></a><span class="MCTextPopupBody popupBody">Shingle Roofing</span>-18-7, <span class="ref-title">Knowledge-Based Condition Assessment Reference Manual for Building Component-Sections</span>, available by download at<MadCapconditionalText data-mc-conditions="Primary.ScreenOnly"> <a href="https://support.sms.erdc.dren.mil/downloads/erdc-cerl-technical-publications">https://support.sms.erdc.dren.mil/downloads/erdc-cerl-technical-publications</a></MadCapconditionalText>. </p>

        <h2>Why Sample?</h2>
        <p>Sampling is a way of breaking up the assessment of large or spatially dispersed Component-Sections into more manageable parts, with each part being assessed individually. The use of sampling can also potentially provide some efficiencies in the assessment process, because the sum of the individual sample quantities need not equal the overall quantity of the Component-Section.</p>
        <h2>When to Use Sampling</h2>
        <p>Performing a condition survey inspection by sampling should be done when the component is large, complex, and/or discontinuous. In a practical sense, this means that the entire Component-Section is not readily viewable. Depending on organizational policies or guidance given to the inspector, sampling may not always be allowed but if it is, the decision to sample or not will be a judgment call made by the inspector based on Building size and Component-Section quantities. Once the <a href="#Minimum" class="MCXref xref">Minimum Representative Sample Quantities</a> has been met, sampling rates are up to the discretion of the inspector and/or organizational policy. Both sampling and non-sampling approaches can be used in the same Building for different Component-Sections.</p>
        <h2><a name="kanchor195"></a>Representative vs. Nonrepresentative Samples</h2>
        <p>Samples may be representative or nonrepresentative. Representative samples are those that <span class="emph" style="font-style: italic;">are</span> in a typical condition for the Component-Section as a whole. This does not mean that they are in exactly the same condition; some variation is expected. Nonrepresentative samples are those that are <span class="emph" style="font-style: italic;">not</span> in typical condition for the Component-Section as a whole. This can be either significantly better or worse condition. The designation as "representative" or not <span class="emph" style="font-style: italic;">will</span> affect the <a href="javascript:void(0)" class="MCTextPopup MCTextPopupHotSpot MCTextPopup_Open glossaryTerm glossaryTermPopup MCTextPopupHotSpot_ MCTextPopupHotSpot_Popup" glossTerm="ESMS-gloss.Term1" xmlns:MadCap="http://www.madcapsoftware.com/Schemas/MadCap.xsd">CI<span class="MCTextPopupBody popupBody"><span class="MCTextPopupArrow"> </span>Condition Index</span></a><span class="MCTextPopupBody popupBody">Condition Index</span>. Nonrepresentative samples are considered isolated, and thus they have less of an influence on the <a href="javascript:void(0)" class="MCTextPopup MCTextPopupHotSpot MCTextPopup_Open glossaryTerm glossaryTermPopup MCTextPopupHotSpot_ MCTextPopupHotSpot_Popup" glossTerm="ESMS-gloss.Term1" xmlns:MadCap="http://www.madcapsoftware.com/Schemas/MadCap.xsd">CI<span class="MCTextPopupBody popupBody"><span class="MCTextPopupArrow"> </span>Condition Index</span></a><span class="MCTextPopupBody popupBody">Condition Index</span> than do representative samples.</p>
        <h2><a name="Minimum"></a><a name="min-sample"></a><a name="kanchor196"></a>Minimum Representative Sample Quantities</h2>
        <p>The minimum quantities specified below are for representative samples. As long as the minimum number of representative samples is met, nonrepresentative samples or additional representative samples may also be added.</p>
        <p>The number of representative (as to condition) samples to be taken of a specific Component-Section with the unit of measure of “each” are listed below:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>One (1) sample when the Component-Section quantity is 1-4.</li>
            <li>Two (2) samples when the Component-Section quantity is 5-9.</li>
            <li>At least three (3) samples when the Component-Section quantity is 10 or more.</li>
            <li>AND a minimum of 10% of the Component-Section quantity.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The number of representative (as to condition) samples to be taken of a specific Component-Section with the unit of measure of square feet (square meters) or linear feet (meters) are listed below:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>One (1) sample when the number of potential samples is 1-4.</li>
            <li>Two (2) samples when the number of potential samples is 5-9.</li>
            <li>At least three (3) samples when the number of potential samples is 10 or more.</li>
            <li>AND a minimum of 10% of the Component-Section quantity.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2><a name="kanchor197"></a>Non-Representative Samples</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Inspect nonrepresentative Component-Sections in addition to the required representative sample quantity amounts.</li>
            <li>Ensure that the nonrepresentative samples are designated as such.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Representative Sample Creation and Selection</h2>
        <p>Representative sample locations and sample sizes are determined by the layout of a given Building. There are a few simple rules to follow, as listed below.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>A general walkthrough of the Building is recommended prior to selecting samples, to ensure that they are representative.</li>
            <li>Use discrete Building discontinuities (e.g., entire rooms, wall corners) to help delineate sample boundaries, especially when the quantity has a unit of measure of square feet (square meters) or linear feet (meters).</li>
            <li>When an area of the Building (e.g., specific room) is selected for sampling, it is recommended but not required that all of the Component-Sections at that location be inspected as part of the sample (e.g., all Component-Sections for all Systems found in a room).</li>
            <li>Specific Component-Sections with a unit-of-measure of “each” should most often be sampled individually, (e.g., sample five of 25 interior doors as five separate samples).</li>
            <li>Sample sizes for Component-Sections with a unit-of-measure of “each” need not be restricted to one.</li>
            <li>Sample sizes are often situation specific. Try to have them be of approximately equal size, but be practical. There will be situations when this is not possible or practical.</li>
            <li>Ensure that all samples are properly identified as to location, including room number or name, if applicable, (think of the next person or inspector – can he/she easily find this location?).</li>
            <li>When sampling is used for a given condition survey inspection cycle, either the distress survey<MadCapconditionalText data-mc-conditions="Primary.34">, <a href="javascript:void(0)" class="MCTextPopup MCTextPopupHotSpot MCTextPopup_Open glossaryTerm glossaryTermPopup MCTextPopupHotSpot_ MCTextPopupHotSpot_Popup" glossTerm="Primary.Term14" xmlns:MadCap="http://www.madcapsoftware.com/Schemas/MadCap.xsd">preventative maintenance<span class="MCTextPopupBody popupBody"><span class="MCTextPopupArrow"> </span>Preventative Maintenance</span></a>,</MadCapconditionalText> or direct condition rating approach may be used for a given Component-Section. However, do <span class="emph" style="font-style: italic;">not</span> combine the methods for any given Component-Section (i.e., don't use distress survey for one sample and direct condition rating for another sample).</li>
        </ul>
        <h2><a name="kanchor198"></a>Sampling Suggestions</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Specific rooms inside of a Building (e.g., "Room 110"), where all of the various Component-Sections in that room would be sampled (e.g., ceiling, walls, wall finish, floor, floor covering, light fixtures, etc.).</li>
            <li>Exterior wall locations (e.g. “North Wall”), where all Component-Sections included in that wall would be sampled (e.g., wall surface, doors, windows, awnings, lights).</li>
            <li>A Component-Section consisting of 10 roof ventilating fans (all 10 are the same) could label samples as “Fan 1”, “Fan 2”, etc.</li>
            <li>Interior doors denoted by room number (e.g., along a hallway) has many doors leading to rooms, so select the requisite number of doors with each door being a sample).</li>
            <li>Specific structural columns, beams, frames, trusses.</li>
            <li>A specific Component-Section (e.g., fireplace) with a quantity greater than one, but still a small number (such as two or three) that are geographically separated such that they cannot be inspected together. Inspect each one as a sample with a specific location. All Component-Sections will need to be inspected to be in conformance with the minimum sample quantity addressed above.</li>
            <li>If an entire Component-Section happens to be co-located at a defined sample location where other Component-Sections were sampled (e.g., a fireplace in a room selected for sampling of walls, ceiling, flooring), that Component-Section can either be included in the sample location or simply inspected without sampling.</li>
            <li>In general, do what makes sense, but ensure that the rules are followed.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Unusual Condition Situations</h3>
        <p>Recall, a primary objective for conducting condition survey inspections is to compute a CSCI for the Component-Section. This CSCI is used for a variety of purposes including developing work plans. Also, it was stated above, that non-representative samples should be inspected and classified so, when warranted. These non-representative samples may be in significantly worse condition than the Component-Section as a whole and may merit work sooner than the Component-Section as a whole (i.e. the work cannot wait until the remainder of the Component-Section deteriorates to the point of needing work). In these cases, it is possible that BUILDER will not trigger work for the Component-Section because the overall condition does not warrant it (the CSCI may be in the “Do Nothing” zone). These situations offer managerial alternatives:</p>
        <ol>
            <li> One alternative is that the distresses can be “flagged” for early work (discussed in the next chapter). </li>
            <li>Another is that Component-Section can be split, with the portion that is significantly worse forming its own Component-Section. An example is a Component-Section of structural columns in a warehouse. Generally, they are in condition where no work actions are needed EXCEPT one column that was severely damaged by a forklift. Splitting this one column into its own Section with its resulting low CSCI is an option.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Sampling may also be used when a distress survey with distress quantity is used to quantify and/or refine work needs. However, the sampling rate must be increased to 100%. For Component-Sections with a unit-of-measure of square feet (square meters) or linear feet (meters) the choice to sample or not is based on convenience. It may be easier to record all on a smaller sample-by-sample basis than for an entire Component-Section. Component-Sections with a unit-of-measure of “each” should always be inspected individually when work needs are being quantified. For example, if a Component-Section consists of ten (10) roof ventilating fans, each fan would be a separate sample and each would be inspected. Thus, ten (10) samples would result.</p>

        <h3>The Importance of Sample Locations</h3>
        <p>The importance of sample locations cannot be overemphasized. The above sections briefly touched on sample locations, but two important considerations of inspection data management (past, present, and future) and field data collection practicalities are addressed below.</p>
        <p>First, the sample location creation possibly provides a basis for collecting condition survey data for a number of different Component-Sections. For example if a room were chosen as a location, the walls, ceiling, light fixtures, etc. could all be inspected and associated with the same location. This can be very useful for future inspections even if all of the Component-Sections are not inspected in a given cycle, because a method of sorting inspection data is by sample location. These locations can be used year after year and will be illustrated later in this manual.</p>
        <p>Second, the creation of sample locations will affect sampling rates and sizes. It was stated earlier that Component-Sections with the unit-of-measure of “each” should be sampled individually. However, sometimes this is impractical. If a sample location has been created that covers a specific area, such as a room, the Component-Section may have a quantity of more than one in that room. A logical clustering of individual items may form a practical basis for a sample. An example would be a Component-Section quantity of one hundred (100) light fixtures in a Building. A room being sampled may have four fixtures out of that total Component-Section quantity. The intent would be to not inspect each light fixture in the sample location room. Rather, all four light fixtures would encompass a single sample. Under these circumstances it becomes important to make all sample sizes roughly the same for a given Component-Section. That is, avoid one sample of four (4) lights and another sample of forty (40) lights.</p>
