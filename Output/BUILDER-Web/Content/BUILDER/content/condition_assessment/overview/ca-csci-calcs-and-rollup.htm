        <p>For distress surveys, the combination of distress type, severity level, and density of the subcomponents of the Section are used to determine the deduct value for the individual subcomponents. The deduct values for each combination of distress, severity, and density were determined during <a href="javascript:void(0)" class="MCTextPopup MCTextPopupHotSpot MCTextPopup_Open glossaryTerm glossaryTermPopup MCTextPopupHotSpot_ MCTextPopupHotSpot_Popup" glossTerm="Primary.Term13" xmlns:MadCap="http://www.madcapsoftware.com/Schemas/MadCap.xsd">ERDC-CERL<span class="MCTextPopupBody popupBody"><span class="MCTextPopupArrow"> </span>U.S. Army Engineer Research and Development Center, Construction Engineering Research Laboratory</span></a><span class="MCTextPopupBody popupBody">U.S. Army Engineer Research and Development Center, Construction Engineering Research Laboratory</span>'s research effort using rating values from a team of experts. </p>
        <p class="indent"><span class="span_1" style="font-weight: bold;">Note:</span> If more than one distress exists for a given Component-Section, the sum of the deduct values for the distresses present must be corrected. This is because as additional distress types and/or severity levels occur on the subcomponent, the impact of a given distress on the condition rating becomes less. This correction correlates the expert panel's ratings and the computed indexes. The correction factor is a function of the summed total of the individual deduct values, a minimum individual deduct value, and the number of different distress types and severity level combinations found. The correction factor values were developed from the rating panel data and are applied directly to the deduct value to produce a corrected deduct value. </p>
