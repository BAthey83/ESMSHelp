        <h1><a name="kanchor211"></a>About Replacement Cost Calculation</h1>
        <h2>Replacement Cost Level: Building vs. Component-Section</h2>
        <p>Only two levels of replacement costs are editable: the costs for Buildings, and the costs for Component-Sections. In the remainder of the asset tree, a Component's cost is determined by totaling the costs of the Component-Sections belonging to it. Similarly, a System's cost is determined by totaling the costs of the Components belonging to it. </p>
        <h2>Replacement Cost Formula</h2>
        <p><a name="kanchor212"></a>Generally the cost to replace, remove, or paint a Component-Section is determined by the following formula:</p>
        <p class="p_26">Total Cost = (Quantity) x (Unit Cost) x (<a href="javascript:void(0)" class="MCTextPopup MCTextPopupHotSpot MCTextPopup_Open glossaryTerm MCTextPopupHotSpot_" glossTerm="Primary.Term1" xmlns:MadCap="http://www.madcapsoftware.com/Schemas/MadCap.xsd">Area Cost Factor<span class="MCTextPopupBody popupBody"><span class="MCTextPopupArrow"> </span>A multiplier that adjusts national average labor/material/equipment costs to local costs. For example, in a remote area with high shipping costs and a tight labor market, the Area Cost Factor might be 1.3.

        <p><a name="kanchor213"></a>The cost to demolish a Building uses the same formula, with the Aggregate Specific Multiplier = 1.0.</p>
        <h2><a name="kanchor214"></a>Replacement Cost Data Source</h2>
        <p><a name="kanchor215"></a>BUILDER uses building replacement cost data from the Tri-Service Military Construction Program in the Reference cost book, and the method described above is essentially the same as the method described in Technical Manual 5-800-4,<span class="ref-title">Programming Cost Estimates for Military Construction</span>, to estimate the replacement cost of each Building. See https://www.wbdg.org/ffc/army-coe/technical-manuals-tm/tm-5-800-4 for the text of this technical manual.</p>

        <ul>
            <li>local costs of construction labor, equipment, and materials</li>
            <li>weather, climate, and seismic requirements</li>
            <li>labor availability</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The Area Cost factor is set at the Site inventory page (requires elevated permissions level).</p>
        <h3>General Multipliers</h3>
        <p>Each general multiplier, applied to all costs of a given level and activity type, is to cover costs including but not limited to supervision/administration, overhead, design, and contract management.</p>
        <h3>Specific Multipliers</h3>
        <p>Specific multipliers account for the extra cost involved to replace, remove, paint, or inspect a Component-Section in a Building that is historic, high security, housing, or has additional access constraints or difficulties. Any given Component-Section can be assigned as many simultaneous specific multipliers as apply.</p>
        <!--       <h3>Aggregate Specific Multiplier</h3>
        <p>$$ The aggregate specific multiplier, where applicable, </p> -->
        <h3>Inflation Factor</h3>
        <p>
            The inflation factor is computed based on the base year of the cost data and the inflation rates given in the default <a href="infl-ref-about.htm">inflation book</a>. If the cost data corresponds to the data in the Reference cost book, then the cost module uses a fixed year for the base year. If you add your own cost book and enter a unit cost different from the Reference set, then the cost module saves the year in which you input that data as the base year for inflation computations.</p>
        <h2>Repair Costs</h2>
        <p>Repair costs are handled differently from replacement costs. The cost module calculates repair costs for Component-Sections as a function of current condition index and the replacement cost computed as above using an algorithm derived through <a href="javascript:void(0)" class="MCTextPopup MCTextPopupHotSpot MCTextPopup_Open glossaryTerm glossaryTermPopup MCTextPopupHotSpot_ MCTextPopupHotSpot_Popup" glossTerm="Primary.Term13" xmlns:MadCap="http://www.madcapsoftware.com/Schemas/MadCap.xsd">ERDC-CERL<span class="MCTextPopupBody popupBody"><span class="MCTextPopupArrow"> </span>U.S. Army Engineer Research and Development Center, Construction Engineering Research Laboratory</span></a><span class="MCTextPopupBody popupBody">U.S. Army Engineer Research and Development Center, Construction Engineering Research Laboratory</span>'s research.</p>
