        <p><a name="kanchor258"></a><span class="mc-variable Primary.Product variable">BUILDER</span> comes with its own data regarding the service life expectancy, in years, of all types of Building Component-Sections. It uses the expected service life data to</p>

            <li>estimate the remaining service life of a Component-Section on the basis of its life expectancy and condition</li>
            <li>estimate the rate of deterioration in the condition index of a Component-Section when no more than one inspection has been recorded</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Service Life Data</h2>
        <p>The service life data used by <span class="mc-variable Primary.Product variable">BUILDER</span> is contained in one or more <span class="new-term">service life books</span>. Multiple service life books can be associated with different Organizations or Sites in the tree, as desired.</p>
        <h3>Default Service Life Book</h3>
        <p>The default service life book provided with <span class="mc-variable Primary.Product variable">BUILDER</span> is named "Reference." It cannot be edited, and it is associated with the top level of the asset tree. The scope of its data, therefore, is the entire asset tree. </p>
        <p>You can choose to depend exclusively on the data in Reference, or you can create one or more custom service life books. </p>
        <h3>Custom Service Life Book(s)</h3>
        <p>To create custom service life data, you can either</p>
        <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
            <li value="1">Edit an existing service life book (except for Reference), or </li>
            <li value="2">Create one or more new service life books. You can use Reference, or another existing service life book, as the starting point for the new service life book.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>By assigning a custom service life book to an Organization or Site, you can control the scope of that service life book, applying custom values to either all or part of the asset tree.</p>
        <p class="indent"><span class="span_1">Note:</span> The only data that you can change in the service life book is the service life and paint life for each Component-Section desired.</p>
        <h2><a name="Assign"></a>Assign a Service Life Book to an Organization or Site</h2>
        <p>You can create multiple service life books, and assign a separate book to any Organization or Site within your permissions scope, as desired. This is done as follows:</p>
        <ol>
            <li value="1">In Inventory mode, navigate to and select the Organization or Site to assign the service life book to.</li>
            <li value="2">At the<span class="span_1"> General Information</span> tab, select the service life book from the dropdown menu in the <span class="span_1">Reference Settings</span> section (requires elevated permissions).
        <p class="p_26" style="text-align: center;"><img src="cost-bk-imgs/assign-ref-cost-book.png" alt="" /></p></li>
            <li value="3">Activate <span class="span_1">Save</span> on the content area toolbar.</li>
        </ol>
        <h2>Example</h2>
        <p>An example of how service life data is gathered and used may be helpful. Suppose the <span class="mc-variable Primary.Product variable">BUILDER</span> service life data indicates that a heavy grade carpet under moderate traffic levels has a life expectancy of 20 years. The 20 years is obviously an average of some sort, and you should know that the average is determined more by the experiences and judgment of multiple facility managers than by statistically accurate field data. Gathering statistically valid data is virtually impossible, even for the manufacturer of a specific carpet type, but especially for the <span class="mc-variable Primary.Product variable">BUILDER</span> database which must match service life with a very generic Component-Section type. If you installed a heavy grade carpet into 1000 Buildings where the traffic level would be classified as moderate and you tracked how many years each carpet remained in the Building before it was replaced, the graph of your data might look something like shown below (keep in mind that this is simply a conceptual picture and does not represent actual data.).</p>
        <p class="p_26" style="text-align: center;">
            <img src="graph.jpg" alt="" />
        </p>
        <p>You can see from this simple graph that by year 20, the majority of the carpet in the 1000 Buildings has been replaced. You can also see that all along the way, some of the carpet is being replaced sooner than 20 years and some later than 20 years. What makes the difference? Many factors may affect how long a particular carpet may be in use: level of daily and periodic cleaning, climate, actual quality of the carpet and of its installation, mission requirements of the tenant, etc. For those factors which affect the condition of the carpet, BUILDER attempts to relate an estimated remaining service life for a specific carpet Component-Section with the condition index of that Section. The <a href="javascript:void(0)" class="MCTextPopup MCTextPopupHotSpot MCTextPopup_Open glossaryTerm glossaryTermPopup MCTextPopupHotSpot_ MCTextPopupHotSpot_Popup" glossTerm="ESMS-gloss.Term1" xmlns:MadCap="http://www.madcapsoftware.com/Schemas/MadCap.xsd">CI<span class="MCTextPopupBody popupBody"><span class="MCTextPopupArrow"> </span>Condition Index</span></a><span class="MCTextPopupBody popupBody">Condition Index</span> of the carpet at any given age gives a good indication of whether the carpet will last less than or more than the average life span. When you perform the process of <MadCapconditionalText data-mc-conditions="Primary.ScreenOnly"><a href="../administration/tools_manual_condition_roll-up.htm">rolling up CIs</a></MadCapconditionalText> for your inventory, one of the computations in the series is to recompute the remaining service life of the Component-Section based on its current <a href="javascript:void(0)" class="MCTextPopup MCTextPopupHotSpot MCTextPopup_Open glossaryTerm glossaryTermPopup MCTextPopupHotSpot_ MCTextPopupHotSpot_Popup" glossTerm="ESMS-gloss.Term1" xmlns:MadCap="http://www.madcapsoftware.com/Schemas/MadCap.xsd">CI<span class="MCTextPopupBody popupBody"><span class="MCTextPopupArrow"> </span>Condition Index</span></a><span class="MCTextPopupBody popupBody">Condition Index</span>, its rate of deterioration during the time between its last two condition assessments, and the expected service life of the item.</p>
        <p>As you can see, the expected service life is a key component in determining two important measures of how well a particular Component-Section is doing. The two are its current condition index and its remaining service life. Service life is used to determine an expected deterioration rate in estimating current condition in the absence of sequential condition assessment data. It is also used in the models that compute remaining service life on the basis of current <a href="javascript:void(0)" class="MCTextPopup MCTextPopupHotSpot MCTextPopup_Open glossaryTerm glossaryTermPopup MCTextPopupHotSpot_ MCTextPopupHotSpot_Popup" glossTerm="ESMS-gloss.Term1" xmlns:MadCap="http://www.madcapsoftware.com/Schemas/MadCap.xsd">CI<span class="MCTextPopupBody popupBody"><span class="MCTextPopupArrow"> </span>Condition Index</span></a><span class="MCTextPopupBody popupBody">Condition Index</span> and rate of deterioration.</p>
        <h2>Source of Service Life Data</h2>
        <p>The service life data in BUILDER's Reference set was derived from data collected during many years of research at <a href="javascript:void(0)" class="MCTextPopup MCTextPopupHotSpot MCTextPopup_Open glossaryTerm glossaryTermPopup MCTextPopupHotSpot_ MCTextPopupHotSpot_Popup" glossTerm="Primary.Term13" xmlns:MadCap="http://www.madcapsoftware.com/Schemas/MadCap.xsd">ERDC-CERL<span class="MCTextPopupBody popupBody"><span class="MCTextPopupArrow"> </span>U.S. Army Engineer Research and Development Center, Construction Engineering Research Laboratory</span></a><span class="MCTextPopupBody popupBody">U.S. Army Engineer Research and Development Center, Construction Engineering Research Laboratory</span>, both during the BUILDER project and by an earlier study that resulted in the Maintenance Resource Prediction Model (MRPM), which has served as the foundation for a number of facility maintenance models. Your experience, however, may be different in terms of how long items last in your Buildings. For example, your Buildings may be in a very wet, windy climate and the roof surfaces may need to be replaced more often, paint may need to be applied more often, wood windows may need to be replaced sooner than the data indicates. BUILDER allows you to edit the service life data to reflect your knowledge and experience with the various Building Components you manage.</p>
