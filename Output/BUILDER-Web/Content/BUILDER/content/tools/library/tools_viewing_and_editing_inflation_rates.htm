        <hr width="100%" size="0" align="center" />
        <p>When costs are computed by the <span class="mc-variable Primary.Product variable">BUILDER</span> cost module, an adjustment is made to account for inflation.</p>
        <p>The inflation data used by the cost module is contained in one or more <span class="new-term">inflation books</span>. A default inflation book is provided and is all that is required. Optionally, multiple customized inflation books can be associated with different Organizations or Sites in the tree; this topic will explain how to do this.</p>
        <p>For more information about the cost module, start with the topic <a href="cost-ref-about.htm" class="MCXref xref">About Cost Books</a>.</p>

        <h2> About Inflation Books</h2>
        <p>The inflation assumptions used by the cost module are contained in one or more <span class="new-term">inflation books</span>. Multiple inflation books can be associated with different Organizations or Sites in the tree, as desired.</p>
        <h3>Default</h3>
        <p>The default inflation book provided with <span class="mc-variable Primary.Product variable">BUILDER</span> is named "Reference." It cannot be edited, and it is associated with the top level of the asset tree. The scope of its data, therefore, is the entire asset tree. </p>
        <p> The data in the Reference set matches the inflation rates used by the Department of Defense for operations and maintenance costs. As time goes on and the economy's ups and downs yield different forecasts of inflation, you should create new inflation sets to more accurately predict out-year costs. </p>
        <h3>Custom</h3>
        <p>To use different inflation data than what is provided in the Reference module, you can create one or more custom inflation books. A new inflation book can be based on Reference, or based on another existing inflation book. Another option for using different inflation data is to edit an existing inflation book (except for Reference).</p>
        <p>Depending on the scope you designate for an inflation book when you assign it to an Organization or Site, you can apply custom values to either all or part of the asset tree.</p>
        <h2>Add an Inflation Book</h2>
        <p>To add an inflation book, </p>
        <ol>
            <li value="1">Starting at the main menu, select <span class="span_1">Tools &gt; Library &gt; Cost Books</span>.
        <p class="p_26" style="text-align: center;"><img src="select-infl-bk-from-main-menu.png" alt="" /></p><p><span class="result">The Inflation Management window will open, showing just the top level of the asset tree.</span></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img src="ref-book-first-opened-v3_4.png" alt="screenshot" /></p></li>
            <li value="2">$$ This belongs in the EDIT list of instructions. Expand the tree in the left portion of the window to reveal what (if any) inflation books are available in the database. For example, the screenshot below shows the USAF cost book.<p class="indent"><span class="span_1">Note:</span> Initially, only one inflation book, Reference, is available. The Reference inflation book cannot be deleted or edited. It is the foundation of all other inflation books you create.</p></li>
        </ol>
        <p class="p_26" style="text-align: center;">
            <img src="tools_lib_test_inflation_book.png" class="img_4" alt="" />
        </p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p><span class="span_1">Managing Inflation Rates</span>
        </p>
        <p>To manage the inflation rates, select <span class="span_1"><a name="kanchor18"></a>Tools &gt; Library &gt; Inflation Books</span> starting at the main menu.</p>
        <p>The Inflation Set Management window will appear.</p>
        <p class="p_26" style="text-align: center;">
            <img src="tools_lib_test_inflation_book.png" class="img_4" alt="" />
        </p>
        <p>Expand the tree in the left portion of the window to show the available inflation sets in the database. As stated above, only the References inflation set is available initially. The Reference inflation set cannot be deleted or edited and serves as the foundation for all other inflation sets you create. You are free to use the Reference inflation set if you like and not add any data of your own.</p>
        <p><span class="span_1">Adding and Editing Inflation Rates</span>
        </p>
        <p>If you would like to edit the inflation rates, you must add your own data set first. To do so, choose the Organization or Site where it applies from the tree, then activate the <span class="span_1">Add</span> button on the toolbar. The New Inflation Set window will appear:</p>
        <p class="p_26" style="text-align: center;">
            <img src="tools_lib_inflation_book_name1.png" class="img_1" alt="" />
        </p>
        <p>Enter the name of the new inflation set, choose the set to copy inflation rates from, and activate <span class="span_1">Add</span>. You will be returned to the Inflation Set Management window, the name of the new book will appear in the Inflation Set dropdown list, and you will see the data corresponding to the book you copied from. You may know edit the inflation rates on a year-by-year basis for the new set in the grid. To edit different inflation sets in your inventory, select them in the tree and their data will appear in the grid.</p>
        <p><span class="span_1"><a name="kanchor19"></a>Choosing the Default Inflation Rate Data Set</span>
        </p>
        <p>After a new inflation set is created, it is available from the inventory screen to use for a given Site, region, or Organization.</p>
