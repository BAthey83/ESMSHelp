        <p>Service life data included with <span class="mc-variable Primary.Product variable">BUILDER</span> allows it to estimate rates of deterioration. Additionally, when combined with current condition, service life data is used to estimate remaining service life for Component-Sections.</p>
        <p>The service life data used by <span class="mc-variable Primary.Product variable">BUILDER</span> is contained in one or more <span class="new-term">service life books</span>. A default service life book is provided and is all that is required. Optionally, multiple customized service life books can be associated with different Organizations or Sites in the tree; this topic will explain how to do this.</p>

        <h2> About Service Life Books</h2>
        <p><a name="kanchor389"></a><span class="mc-variable Primary.Product variable">BUILDER</span> comes equipped with data regarding the service life expectancy, in years, of all types of Building Component-Sections. It uses the expected service life data in multiple ways: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>First and foremost, <span class="mc-variable Primary.Product variable">BUILDER</span> estimates the remaining service life of a Component-Section on the basis of its life expectancy and condition. </li>
            <li>Second, the expected service life is used in estimating a rate of deterioration in the condition index of a Component-Section when no more than one inspection has been recorded.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>More detail about how <span class="mc-variable Primary.Product variable">BUILDER</span>'s default service life data was obtained is located below at <a href="#Addendum" class="MCXref xref">Addendum: Reference Service Life Data</a>.</p>
        <h3>Default</h3>
        <p>The default service life book provided with <span class="mc-variable Primary.Product variable">BUILDER</span> is named "Reference." It cannot be edited, and it is associated with the top level of the asset tree. The scope of its data, therefore, is the entire asset tree. </p>
        <p>The service life data in <span class="mc-variable Primary.Product variable">BUILDER</span>'s Reference set was derived from data collected during many years of research at <a href="javascript:void(0)" class="MCTextPopup MCTextPopupHotSpot MCTextPopup_Open glossaryTerm glossaryTermPopup MCTextPopupHotSpot_ MCTextPopupHotSpot_Popup" glossTerm="Primary.Term13" xmlns:MadCap="http://www.madcapsoftware.com/Schemas/MadCap.xsd">ERDC-CERL<span class="MCTextPopupBody popupBody"><span class="MCTextPopupArrow"> </span>U.S. Army Engineer Research and Development Center, Construction Engineering Research Laboratory</span></a><span class="MCTextPopupBody popupBody">U.S. Army Engineer Research and Development Center, Construction Engineering Research Laboratory</span>, both during the <span class="mc-variable Primary.Product variable">BUILDER</span> project and by an earlier study that resulted in the Maintenance Resource Prediction Model (MRPM), which has served as the foundation for a number of facility maintenance models. </p>
        <p>You can choose to depend exclusively on the data in Reference, or you can create one or more custom service life books. </p>
        <h3>Custom</h3>
        <p>Compared to the Reference data, your experience may be different in terms of how long items last in your Buildings. For example, your Buildings may be in a very wet, windy climate and the roof surfaces may need to be replaced more often; paint may need to be applied more often, and wood windows may need to be replaced sooner than the data indicates. <span class="mc-variable Primary.Product variable">BUILDER</span> allows you to create one or more alternate service life books and to edit the service life data to reflect your knowledge and experience with the various Building Components you manage.</p>
        <p>To use different service life data than what is provided in the Reference module, you can create one or more new service life books.  Another option for using different service life data is to edit an existing service life book (except for Reference).</p>
        <p>Depending on the scope you designate for a service life book when you assign it to an Organization or Site, you can apply custom values to either all or part of the asset tree.</p>
        <p><span class="span_1">Creating and Editing Service Life Data</span>
        </p>
        <p>To manage the service life data, select <span class="span_1"><a name="kanchor390"></a>Tools &gt; Library &gt; Service Life Data</span> starting at the main menu. </p>
        <p class="p_26" style="text-align: center;">
            <img src="tools_library_service_life_books.png" alt="" />
        </p>
        <p>The Service Life Management window will appear when you activate Reference on the left hand side.</p>
        <p class="p_26" style="text-align: center;">
            <img src="tools_lib_custom_service_life_book_950x400.png" alt="" style="width: 950;height: 400;" />
        </p>
        <p>Expand the tree in the left portion of the window to show the available service life data sets. Initially, only one service life data set, Reference, is available. The Reference data set cannot be deleted or edited, and serves as the foundation of all other service life data sets you create. You are free to use the Reference service life data set if you like and not add any data of your own. </p>
        <p><span class="span_1">Editing Service Life Data</span>
        </p>
        <p>If you would like to edit the service life data, you must create your own data set first. To do so, activate the <span class="span_1">Add</span> button on the toolbar.</p>
        <p class="p_26" style="text-align: center;">
            <img src="tools_lib_service_life_add.png" alt="" />
        </p>
        <p>The Service Life Management window will appear.</p>
        <p class="p_26" style="text-align: center;">
            <img src="tools_lib_new_service_life_book.png" alt="" />
        </p>
        <p><a name="kanchor391"></a><a name="kanchor392"></a>Enter the name of the new service life book, choose the book to copy service life data from, and activate <span class="span_1">Add</span>. You will be returned to the Service Life Management window, the name of the new book will appear in the Service Life Set field, and you will see the data corresponding to the book you copied from. You may now edit the service life (SL) and paint life (PL) for the Sections in the grid, which is filtered by System. To edit different service life sets in your inventory, select them in the tree and their data will appear in the grid.</p>

        <p><span class="span_1">Assigning Service Life Books</span>
        </p>
        <p>You can create multiple Service Life books, and assign separate ones to each Organization or Site. This is done in the Inventory mode by selecting the Organization or Site to assign the Service Life book to, and selecting the Service Life book from the drop down menu in the Reference Settings.</p>

        <p>$$ from training video: "Relationship between SL and condition" BUILDER uses Weibull probability distribution function (("the" function, or "functions" plural?)) to model lifecycle condition and estimate time to failure, based on inspection information collected during condition assessment. END</p>
-->
        <p>An example of how service life data is gathered and used may be helpful. Suppose the <span class="mc-variable Primary.Product variable">BUILDER</span> service life data indicates that a heavy grade carpet under moderate traffic levels has a life expectancy of 20 years. The 20 years is obviously an average of some sort, and you should know that the average is determined more by the experiences and judgment of multiple facility managers than by statistically accurate field data. Gathering statistically valid data is virtually impossible, even for the manufacturer of a specific carpet type, but especially for the <span class="mc-variable Primary.Product variable">BUILDER</span> database which must match service life with a very generic Component-Section type. If you installed a heavy grade carpet into a thousand Buildings where the traffic level would be classified as moderate, and you tracked how many years each carpet remained in the Building before it was replaced, the graph of your data might look something like shown below (keep in mind that this is simply a conceptual picture and does not represent actual data.).</p>
        <p class="p_26" style="text-align: center;">
            <img src="graph.jpg" alt="" />
        </p>
        <p>You can see from this simple graph that by year 20, the majority of the carpet in the 1000 Buildings has been replaced. You can also see that all along the way, some of the carpet is being replaced sooner than 20 years and some later than 20 years. What makes the difference? Many factors may affect how long a particular carpet may be in use: level of daily and periodic cleaning, climate, actual quality of the carpet and of its installation, mission requirements of the tenant, etc. For those factors which affect the condition of the carpet, <span class="mc-variable Primary.Product variable">BUILDER</span> attempts to relate an estimated remaining service life for a specific carpet Component-Section with the condition index of that Section. The <a href="javascript:void(0)" class="MCTextPopup MCTextPopupHotSpot MCTextPopup_Open glossaryTerm glossaryTermPopup MCTextPopupHotSpot_ MCTextPopupHotSpot_Popup" glossTerm="ESMS-gloss.Term1" xmlns:MadCap="http://www.madcapsoftware.com/Schemas/MadCap.xsd">CI<span class="MCTextPopupBody popupBody"><span class="MCTextPopupArrow"> </span>Condition Index</span></a><span class="MCTextPopupBody popupBody">Condition Index</span> of the carpet at any given age gives a good indication of whether the carpet will last less than or more than the average life span. When you perform the process of <a href="../administration/tools_manual_condition_roll-up.htm">rolling up CIs</a> for your inventory, one of the computations in the series is to recompute the remaining service life of the Component-Section based on its current <a href="javascript:void(0)" class="MCTextPopup MCTextPopupHotSpot MCTextPopup_Open glossaryTerm glossaryTermPopup MCTextPopupHotSpot_ MCTextPopupHotSpot_Popup" glossTerm="ESMS-gloss.Term1" xmlns:MadCap="http://www.madcapsoftware.com/Schemas/MadCap.xsd">CI<span class="MCTextPopupBody popupBody"><span class="MCTextPopupArrow"> </span>Condition Index</span></a><span class="MCTextPopupBody popupBody">Condition Index</span>, its rate of deterioration during the time between its last two condition assessments, and the expected service life of the item.</p>
        <p>As you can see, the expected service life is a key component in determining two important measures of how well a particular Component-Section is doing. The other key component is the Component-Section's current condition index. Service life is used to determine an expected deterioration rate in estimating current condition in the absence of sequential condition assessment data. It is also used in the models that compute remaining service life on the basis of current <a href="javascript:void(0)" class="MCTextPopup MCTextPopupHotSpot MCTextPopup_Open glossaryTerm glossaryTermPopup MCTextPopupHotSpot_ MCTextPopupHotSpot_Popup" glossTerm="ESMS-gloss.Term1" xmlns:MadCap="http://www.madcapsoftware.com/Schemas/MadCap.xsd">CI<span class="MCTextPopupBody popupBody"><span class="MCTextPopupArrow"> </span>Condition Index</span></a><span class="MCTextPopupBody popupBody">Condition Index</span> and rate of deterioration.</p>
        <p>The service life data in <span class="mc-variable Primary.Product variable">BUILDER</span>'s Reference set was derived from data collected during many years of research at <a href="javascript:void(0)" class="MCTextPopup MCTextPopupHotSpot MCTextPopup_Open glossaryTerm glossaryTermPopup MCTextPopupHotSpot_ MCTextPopupHotSpot_Popup" glossTerm="Primary.Term13" xmlns:MadCap="http://www.madcapsoftware.com/Schemas/MadCap.xsd">ERDC-CERL<span class="MCTextPopupBody popupBody"><span class="MCTextPopupArrow"> </span>U.S. Army Engineer Research and Development Center, Construction Engineering Research Laboratory</span></a><span class="MCTextPopupBody popupBody">U.S. Army Engineer Research and Development Center, Construction Engineering Research Laboratory</span>, both during the <span class="mc-variable Primary.Product variable">BUILDER</span> project and by an earlier study that resulted in the Maintenance Resource Prediction Model (MRPM), which has served as the foundation for a number of facility maintenance models. </p>
