        <p>Custom asset attributes can be added at each inventory level, from Organization down through Section, in two different ways: by using "active attributes" or by using "Admin managed attributes."</p>

        <h2>What are Admin Managed Attributes?</h2>
        <p>Admin managed attributes are a collection of pre-named asset attributes that have been determined by the <span class="mc-variable Primary.Product variable">BUILDER</span> instance's owner (for example, a corporation, or the Air Force, or the Army). They are templated or common attributes that are seen as likely to be used often. Some or all of these attributes are made available from the outset after installing <span class="mc-variable Primary.Product variable">BUILDER</span>. If more are needed, only a <span class="mc-variable Primary.Product variable">BUILDER</span> administrator or a user with <a href="javascript:void(0)" class="MCTextPopup MCTextPopupHotSpot MCTextPopup_Open glossaryTerm MCTextPopupHotSpot_" glossTerm="Primary.Term41" xmlns:MadCap="http://www.madcapsoftware.com/Schemas/MadCap.xsd">Master Planner<span class="MCTextPopupBody popupBody"><span class="MCTextPopupArrow"> </span>A user with Master Planner Role has all the rights of a Work Planners, and can also generate multi-year work plan scenarios, and edit any and all data saved by other users of the program.

        <p>With respect to creating reports, Admin managed attributes will be easier to report on in a consistent fashion, because they are managed by a <span class="mc-variable Primary.Product variable">BUILDER</span> <a href="javascript:void(0)" class="MCTextPopup MCTextPopupHotSpot MCTextPopup_Open glossaryTerm MCTextPopupHotSpot_" glossTerm="Primary.Term6" xmlns:MadCap="http://www.madcapsoftware.com/Schemas/MadCap.xsd">Administrator<span class="MCTextPopupBody popupBody"><span class="MCTextPopupArrow"> </span>A user with Administrator Role can administer users, assign users to Roles, and change software configuration settings.</span></a><span class="MCTextPopupBody popupBody">A user with BUILDER or ROOFER Administrator Role can administer users, assign users to Roles, and change software configuration settings.</span> (or a user with <a href="javascript:void(0)" class="MCTextPopup MCTextPopupHotSpot MCTextPopup_Open glossaryTerm MCTextPopupHotSpot_" glossTerm="Primary.Term41" xmlns:MadCap="http://www.madcapsoftware.com/Schemas/MadCap.xsd">Master Planner<span class="MCTextPopupBody popupBody"><span class="MCTextPopupArrow"> </span>A user with Master Planner Role has all the rights of a Work Planners, and can also generate multi-year work plan scenarios, and edit any and all data saved by other users of the program.

Also, Admin managed attributes are available to all assets at the same inventory level. Active attributes, on the other hand, would be prone to being named inconsistently and make reporting more difficult.</p>
        <h2><a name="Add"></a>Add an Admin Managed Attribute</h2>
        <p>Under <span class="span_1">Admin Managed Attributes</span> at the bottom half of the Attributes screen, you can add, <a href="#Edit">edit</a>, or <a href="#Delete">delete</a> custom Admin managed attributes for this level of inventory. Also, in the <span class="span_1">Unassigned Admin Managed Attributes</span> column, you can choose to <a href="#Assign">assign</a> an existing but unassigned Admin managed attribute to the asset whose data screen you have open.</p>
        <p>When you add an Admin managed attribute, it will automatically be assigned to the asset where you are adding it. For all other assets at the same inventory level, the new attribute will be available in the <span class="span_1">Unassigned Admin Managed Attributes</span> column. </p>
        <p>To add an Admin managed attribute,</p>
        <ol>
            <li value="1">Directly under the <span class="span_1">Admin Managed Attributes</span> header at the lower right of the Attributes screen, activate <span class="span_1">Create New Managed Attribute</span>. This will generate a new row in the <span class="span_1">Admin Managed Attributes</span> table.                </li>
            <li value="2"> Enter an Attribute Name and Value for your attribute into the table.
</li>
            <li value="3">
                If you want to apply an architect name, press the Enter key at this point . The popup "Add Architect" will appear. Enter the name of the architect, then select <span class="span_1">OK</span>.
            </li>
            <li value="4">When finished with the entry, <span class="span_1">activate the blue checkmark icon at the left side of the row</span> to save the entry. Alternatively, to cancel and delete the entry before saving, activate the red circle with a slash icon (located to the right of the blue checkmark).
        <p class="indent"><span class="span_1">CAUTION:</span> Your new attribute will not be saved if you (a) exit without activating the blue checkmark or (b) initiate adding a new custom inventory attribute (by activating the <span class="span_1">Add New Attribute</span> button) before saving with the blue checkmark.</p></li>
        </ol>
        <h2><a name="Edit"></a>Edit an Admin Managed Attribute</h2>
        <p>To edit an attribute, </p>
        <ol>
            <li value="1">Activate the pencil icon in the attribute's table row, and wait for the row to change appearance.</li>
            <li value="2">Make the desired changes.</li>
            <li value="3">Finally, activate the blue checkmark icon at the left to save the changes (or the red Cancel icon to cancel the change).</li>
        </ol>
        <h2><a name="Delete"></a>Delete an Admin Managed Attribute</h2>
        <p>When you "delete" an Admin managed attribute it is removed from the <span class="span_1">Admin Managed Attributes</span> table for the asset, and moved to <span class="span_1">Unassigned Admin Managed Attributes</span>.</p>
        <p>To delete an attribute,</p>
        <ol>
            <li value="1">In the table of Admin managed attributes, locate the row containing the attribute you wish to delete.</li>
            <li value="2">To the right of the <span class="span_1">Value</span> field, activate the Delete icon (red X). A confirmation popup will appear, asking "Delete record?" </li>
            <li value="3">Select <span class="span_1">OK</span> to delete, or <span class="span_1">Cancel</span> to stop the process.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>After deletion, the attribute will be transferred to the Unassigned column for that asset. </p>
        <h2><a name="Assign"></a>Assign an Unassigned Attribute to Admin Management</h2>
        <p>You may see one or more items listed under the header <span class="span_1">Unassigned Admin Managed Attributes</span> at the lower left of the Attributes screen. If so, these are available to be applied to the selected asset.</p>
        <p>To assign an asset to Admin management,</p>
        <p>In the <span class="span_1">Unassigned Admin Managed Attributes</span> column, activate <span class="span_1">Assign to Asset</span>. </p>

        </p>
        <p><span class="result">This will immediately populate the attribute to the <span class="span_1">Admin Managed Attributes</span> table instead.</span>

            <img src="../../resources/snippets/snippet-images/inv-attrs-admin-managed-assigned-after.png" alt="" />
        </p>
        <p> The assignment action is reversible by deleting that attribute from the <span class="span_1">Admin Managed Attributes</span> table. See <a href="#Delete" class="MCXref xref">Delete an Admin Managed Attribute</a> for instructions.</p>
