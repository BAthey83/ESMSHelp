            <h1><a name="kanchor502"></a>General Distresses: Cracked</h1>
            <p><span class="span_1">Definition:</span>
            </p>
            <p>Subcomponent has been fractured. Separation into two or more pieces may or may not have occurred. Crack width may be variable and faulting may be present. There is no loss of operational ability to the subcomponent or Component-Section.</p>
        </div>
        <p class="noBreakAfter">Notes:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>A hairline crack is defined as having a width so small as to be very tight.</li>
            <li>Care must be taken to differentiate between “Cracked,” “Broken,” “Damaged,” and “Deteriorated.” “Cracked” implies that the fractured pieces are intact, whereas “Broken” implies that some of the resulting cracked pieces are missing or a loss of operational ability. Fracturing may possibly be caused by a specific event which suggests the distress type “Damaged.” However, record as “Cracked.” Likewise, fracturing can occur as a consequence of weathering, humidity change, and sustained or repeated loading over long periods suggesting “Deteriorated.” However, record “Cracked.”</li>
            <li>“Cracked” and the distress types “Broken” and/or “Damaged” can occur together in the same subcomponent-Section, but only independently at different locations (e.g. different ceiling tiles in the same Component-Section).</li>
            <li>If the fractured pieces are faulted, record the distress type “Displaced” also.</li>
            <li>If the subcomponent is a tank, pipe, container, trough, pressure vessel, or sealant and as a result of the crack a leak has occurred, record the severity level as High and the distress type “Leaks,” also.</li>
            <li>Density is determined from dividing total crack length by the subcomponent surface area or length, as appropriate.</li>
            <li>If the subcomponent unit-of-measure is “Each” estimate the density if the subcomponent is repairable or 100% if it must be replaced. (See General Notes #10). If multiple cracks exist at different severity levels, record at the highest level.</li>
            <li>If the subcomponent unit-of-measure is square feet (square meters) or linear feet (meters) and cracking has occurred in subcomponents where the logical repair would be the replacement of a unit (e.g. ceiling tile, window pane, pipe section, etc.) the measurement quantity will be that entire unit even though the actual crack may only encompass portion of that unit. If the subcomponent can be patched, the measurement quantity will only encompass the area to be potentially patched.</li>
            <li>Assign only one severity level to a given logical replacement area, length, or quantity measured as described above (#8).</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="noBreakAfter"><span class="span_1">Severity Levels:</span>
        </p>
        <p>Low - Hairline cracks which may or may not divide the subcomponent into pieces. If distinct pieces exist, they are held tightly together.</p>
        <p>Medium - Crack width greater than hairline and the subcomponent has been divided into pieces with clear separation, but not raised to the level of High.</p>
        <p class="noBreakAfter">High - Any of the following exists:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Health, life/safety, security, or structural integrity problems.</li>
            <li>Other subcomponents, component-sections, equipment, furnishings, material, or other building contents may be damaged from the entry of rain, snow, wind, groundwater, etc.</li>
            <li>A leak has resulted in a tank, pipe, container, trough, pressure vessel, or sealant.</li>
            <li>The undesired passage of animals, birds, or insects is occurring.</li>
            <li>The operation of another subcomponent, the parent Component-Section, or another Component-Section is adversely affected.</li>
            <li>The subcomponent is unusable.</li>
        </ul>
