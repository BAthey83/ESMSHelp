        <h1><a name="kanchor256"></a>Understanding the <span class="mc-variable Primary35.Product variable">BUILDER</span>â„¢ Inventory Hierarchy
</h1>
        <!-- Omit, because reviewers don't get my talk of aggegation: <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/INV-Hierarchy-Default.flsnp" /> -->
        <p>The hierarchy that has been designed and built out in a given <span class="mc-variable Primary.Product variable" style="font-weight: bold;">BUILDER</span> implementation is shown in the <a href="gs_navigating_builder.htm#Navigati2">navigation pane</a> at the left hand side of the <span class="mc-variable Primary.Product variable" style="font-weight: bold;">BUILDER</span> screen. Activate the "plus" boxes to expand the inventory tree shown there.</p>
        <p>The levels of hierarchy available in a <span class="mc-variable Primary.Product variable" style="font-weight: bold;">BUILDER</span> inventory tree are as follows:</p>
        <ul style="margin-top: 0;margin-bottom: 0;">
            <li>Top node: This will be a single Organization or a single Site. The topmost position can not be shared; only one Organization or Site can be at the topmost level.</li>
            <li>
                <img src="../resources/icons/organization_gray_19x20.png" alt="organization icon" /> Organization (Having an Organization level is optional; if the top node is a Site, there can be no Organization in the tree)</li>
            <li>
                <img src="../resources/icons/site_gray_19x20.png" alt="site icon" /> Site</li>
            <li>
                <img src="../resources/icons/complex_gray_22x20.png" alt="complex icon" /> Complex</li>
            <li>
                <img src="../resources/icons/building_gray_20x20.png" alt="building icon" /> Facility / Building</li>
            <li>
                <img src="../resources/icons/system_icon.gif" alt="system icon" /> System</li>
            <li>
                <img src="../resources/icons/component_icon.gif" alt="component icon" /> Component</li>
            <li>
                <img src="../resources/icons/section_icon.gif" alt="section icon" /> Section</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Each of these levels is described briefly under headings below. </p>
        <h2>Icon Colors</h2>
        <p>Condition and functionality metrics used in <span class="mc-variable Primary.Product variable" style="font-weight: bold;">BUILDER</span> are communicated upwards through the hierarchy in weighted fashion. At each level of the hierarchy, the condition or functionality index for that level provides an understanding of the average condition/functionality of the real property contained in all the inventory items under the specified Organization, Site, Complex, Building, System, or Component. The value of the index will determine whether the inventory icon for any given inventory item appears as green, amber, or red. Gray indicates that no assessment has been recorded in <span class="mc-variable Primary.Product variable" style="font-weight: bold;">BUILDER</span> for anything under that asset. </p>
        <h2>Levels of Hierarchy</h2>
        <h3 style="font-style: italic;">Top node</h3>
        <p>Your inventory tree will have one and only one "node" at the top, typically named for your service branch, installation, or company. This can only be an Organization or a Site.</p>
        <h3 style="font-style: italic;">Organization </h3>
        <p>Organization is the highest possible level in the inventory tree. However, it is not a required level. Depending on the scope of your <span class="mc-variable Primary.Product variable" style="font-weight: bold;">BUILDER</span> implementation, it is possible to start with the Site level instead.</p>
        <p>Unlike the other hierarchical levels, the Organization level may be nested more than one deep. When designing the inventory tree before implementing and filling out your inventory, it is important to accommodate in the inventory tree the highest possible Organization level you may want to expand to in the future. For more detail, see the section on implementation planning <!-- **afdo add link when this/these topic(s) is/are done -->.</p>
        <p>In the hierarchy tree, an Organization can have either (a)&#160;one or more Sites, (b)&#160;one or more Organizations, or (c)&#160;both created underneath it.</p>
        <p>For more information about this hierarchical level, see <MadCapconditionalText data-mc-conditions="Primary.ScreenOnly"><a href="../inventory/groups/inv_about_organization_group.htm" class="MCXref xref">Working with Organizations</a></MadCapconditionalText>.</p>
        <h3><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">Site</span>
        </h3>
        <p>The level below Organization is the Site, which usually refers to a geographic location. The <a href="javascript:void(0)" class="MCTextPopup MCTextPopupHotSpot MCTextPopup_Open MCTextPopupHotSpot_ #text"><a href="javascript:void(0)" class="MCTextPopup MCTextPopupHotSpot MCTextPopup_Open glossaryTerm MCTextPopupHotSpot_" glossTerm="Primary.Term1" xmlns:MadCap="http://www.madcapsoftware.com/Schemas/MadCap.xsd">Area Cost Factor<span class="MCTextPopupBody popupBody"><span class="MCTextPopupArrow"> </span>A multiplier that adjusts national average labor/material/equipment costs to local costs. For example, in a remote area with high shipping costs and a tight labor market, the Area Cost Factor might be 1.3.

For example, in a remote area with high shipping costs and a tight labor market, the Area Cost Factor might be 1.3.

Other features that are set at the Site level are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Seismic Zone</li>
            <li>HVAC Zone</li>
        </ul>
        <p>(In practice, a Site as a whole will typically have a facility manager who is responsible for day-to-day management of the Site, often with the assistance of subsidiary personnel.)
        </p>
        <p>Just as an Organization can have one or more Sites and/or other Organizations created underneath it, in the <a href="javascript:void(0)" class="MCTextPopup MCTextPopupHotSpot MCTextPopup_Open MCTextPopupHotSpot_ MCTextPopupHotSpot_Popup #text #textPopup"><a href="javascript:void(0)" class="MCTextPopup MCTextPopupHotSpot MCTextPopup_Open glossaryTerm glossaryTermPopup MCTextPopupHotSpot_ MCTextPopupHotSpot_Popup" glossTerm="Primary.Term0" xmlns:MadCap="http://www.madcapsoftware.com/Schemas/MadCap.xsd">SMS<span class="MCTextPopupBody popupBody"><span class="MCTextPopupArrow"> </span>Sustainment Management System</span></a> <span class="MCTextPopupBody popupBody">Sustainment Management System</span></a>hierarchy a Site can have any combination of Complexes and/or Buildings beneath it. </p>
        <p>For more information, see <a href="../inventory/sites/about_sites.htm" class="MCXref xref" data-mc-conditions="Primary.ScreenOnly">Working with Sites</a></p>
        <h3><i>Complex</i>
        </h3>
        <div class="kt">
            <p>A Complex is an optional grouping of Buildings or facilities. This feature is particularly useful for groupings of Buildings with similar Building Use types or locations.</p>
        </div>
        <p class="indent"><span class="span_1" style="font-weight: bold;">Note:</span> Grouping Buildings into a Complex is done after creating the Buildings, not before.</p>
        <p>For more information, see <a href="../inventory/complexes/about_complexes.htm" class="MCXref xref" data-mc-conditions="Primary.ScreenOnly">Working with Complexes</a>.</p>
        <h3><i>Facility / Building</i>
            <br />
        </h3>
        <p>A Building is a stand-alone building or other facility. At this level in the hierarchy, you can see details such as year constructed, size/area, condition indexes, and work item history. Attachments such as floor plans and photographs can be associated with the Building level.</p>
        <p>For more information, see <a href="../inventory/buildings/about_buildings.htm" class="MCXref xref" data-mc-conditions="Primary.ScreenOnly">Working with Buildings</a>.</p>
        <h3><i>Systems, Components, and Sections</i>
        </h3>
        <p>In <span class="mc-variable Primary.Product variable" style="font-weight: bold;">BUILDER</span>, a Building is divided in to Systems, then further divided into Components, following the UNIFORMAT II system shown in <a href="../inventory/systems,_components,_and_sections/systems/inv_builder_systems-table.htm" class="MCXref xref" data-mc-conditions="Primary.ScreenOnly">BUILDER Systems and Components</a>. BUILDER Systems equate to Level 2 Group Elements, and BUILDER Components equate to Level 3 in the UNIFORMAT classification.</p>
        <p>Components are then divided into Component-Sections, also called Sections. It is at the Section level that inspection information is recorded into <span class="mc-variable Primary.Product variable" style="font-weight: bold;">BUILDER</span>.</p>
