        <h1><a name="kanchor346"></a>About Scenarios </h1>
        <p>The Scenarios simulation tool allows you to project facilities sustainment work requirements for up to ten years in the future. This can be done at the Site level (by the installation manager, for example). Simulations can also be run across an entire Organization, at any Organization level.</p>
        <p>The purpose of this overview is to explain how the Scenarios tool does this and how you can benefit from using its projections to improve your facility management practices.</p>
        <h2>Advantages of Using Scenarios</h2>
        <p>This section shows how this tool can be used advantageously to</p>
        <ul>
            <li>establish and defend a long-term facilities sustainment budget</li>
            <li>base your facilities sustainment budget on your actual inventory in its current condition</li>
            <li>identify and quantify the consequences of a facilities sustainment backlog</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The ability to run a simulation with different settings makes Scenarios a valuable tool in creating a credible long-term facilities sustainment budget. For a manager of a large number of buildings, establishing and defending a budget for the next 5 to 10 years is a very difficult problem. Often, managers use industry-standard planning factors to prepare a budget. Figures such as 2% - 4% of building replacement cost per year are often used. The DoD Facility Cost Handbook publishes a cost per square foot for facilities sustainment by Building Use (category code), a planning tool similar to several commercial tools which also use a per-square-foot factor for building sustainment. One problem with these methods of forecasting costs is that they are each based on the assumption of a continuing investment that allows the manager to repair what needs to be repaired when it needs to be repaired, which assumes no backlog of facilities sustainment . Very few managers have ever had sufficient funds to meet that assumption. Another problem with these methods is that they are averages that could miss the mark in any given year for any given Building by a factor of 2, 3, or much more. The manager of a thousand buildings could be faced with a very large shortfall. Still another problem is that budgets prepared with planning factors are difficult to defend. If cuts are to be made, the manager is hard pressed to identify what will suffer. Without the ability to identify consequences, erosion of funds is inevitable.</p>
        <p>Scenarios gives you the opportunity to prepare a long-term facilities sustainment budget based on your actual inventory in its current condition. When Scenarios has finished a running a scenario, it has produced records that tell the story about what is forecast to happen under the scenario's parameters. Each Component-Section in the inventory is tracked during the simulation. Dated condition assessments track expected deterioration. Dated work items show when work was done and how much it costs. When grouped by year, the work items provide an annual work plan constrained by expected funding levels. Annual work plans can be summarized by cost of completed and incomplete work, allowing you know what the backlog was each year and you know which work went unfunded. With rolled-up <a href="javascript:void(0)" class="MCTextPopup MCTextPopupHotSpot MCTextPopup_Open glossaryTerm glossaryTermPopup MCTextPopupHotSpot_ MCTextPopupHotSpot_Popup" glossTerm="ESMS-gloss.Term1" xmlns:MadCap="http://www.madcapsoftware.com/Schemas/MadCap.xsd">CI<span class="MCTextPopupBody popupBody"><span class="MCTextPopupArrow"> </span>Condition Index</span></a><span class="MCTextPopupBody popupBody">Condition Index</span> values, you can determine how well buildings or even locations did over the simulated period.</p>
        <p>You can run a scenario either constrained or unconstrained by budget. With an unconstrained budget, all work items are completed when they are first recognized. Analysis of this type of scenario will provide estimates of your total annual requirement. With a constrained budget, work items are funded in rank order until funds are exhausted. Work items not completed in one year will be generated the following year at a higher cost due to inflation and, for repair work types, to the cost for additional deterioration. Analysis of a constrained scenario will give you insight into what parts of your inventory will suffer at a given funding level.</p>
        <h2>Required Data</h2>
        <p>The data required to construct a <span class="mc-variable Primary.Product variable">BUILDER</span> database and its embedded knowledge and methods regarding condition assessment, component life expectancy, and costs combine to provide a complete model of your facilities and business processes. This includes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>where your facilities are and the effect of location on costs</li>
            <li>records of each Building's use, age, size, construction type, etc.</li>
            <li>decomposition of each Building into its Component-Sections, specified as to type, material, quantity, age, etc.</li>
            <li>history of past condition assessments of each Component-Section, with a dated condition index rating for each</li>
            <li>history of facilities sustainment work performed</li>
            <li>cost estimating capability for various work activities related to Building components</li>
            <li>expected service life and paint life of each component by material category and type</li>
            <li>models for projecting condition and remaining service life on the basis of past condition assessment results</li>
            <li>standards, policies, and policy sequences for determining when work is required</li>
            <li>prioritization schemes for ranking a given set of work items by their importance</li>
            <li>funding sources with their future expected levels of funding, their restrictions, and their order of allocation</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Scenarios uses all of this information as the basis for predicting how your inventory will change over time.</p>
        <p> <span class="mc-variable Primary.Product variable">BUILDER</span> shows you the past and present for your inventory. Scenarios shows you the future. It is able to show you the future in very much the same way that <span class="mc-variable Primary.Product variable">BUILDER</span> is able to show you the past and present. That is, Scenarios shows you the future by adding and changing records in your database at each step in simulated time the same way that you add or change records with the passing of real time. </p>
        <p>The difference is that, for example, when you add a new condition assessment record, it is based on a physical observation, whereas when Scenarios adds a new condition assessment, it has calculated the expected condition based on prior condition, deterioration rates, and work activity records. As another example, a work item in <span class="mc-variable Primary.Product variable">BUILDER</span> may be subject to a good deal of off-line planning and debate before it is finally funded and complete, while in Scenarios the prioritization scheme and funding algorithms methodically calculate whether or not a particular work item can be completed.</p>
        <h2>Outline of Scenarios</h2>
        <p><a name="kanchor347"></a>The following list is a brief description of how Scenarios simulates change in your inventory over a one- to ten-year period, starting at the date the scenario is run.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>with the current inventory, updates all time-sensitive data elements (<a href="javascript:void(0)" class="MCTextPopup MCTextPopupHotSpot MCTextPopup_Open glossaryTerm glossaryTermPopup MCTextPopupHotSpot_ MCTextPopupHotSpot_Popup" glossTerm="ESMS-gloss.Term1" xmlns:MadCap="http://www.madcapsoftware.com/Schemas/MadCap.xsd">CI<span class="MCTextPopupBody popupBody"><span class="MCTextPopupArrow"> </span>Condition Index</span></a><span class="MCTextPopupBody popupBody">Condition Index</span>, <a href="javascript:void(0)" class="MCTextPopup MCTextPopupHotSpot MCTextPopup_Open glossaryTerm glossaryTermPopup MCTextPopupHotSpot_ MCTextPopupHotSpot_Popup" glossTerm="ESMS-gloss.Term4" xmlns:MadCap="http://www.madcapsoftware.com/Schemas/MadCap.xsd">RSL<span class="MCTextPopupBody popupBody"><span class="MCTextPopupArrow"> </span>Remaining Service Life</span></a><span class="MCTextPopupBody popupBody">Remaining Service Life</span>, Cost) for every Component-Section as of the current date</li>
            <li>uses the selected <a href="../work_management/standards,_policies,_and_policy_sequences/wm_adding_and_editing_policy_sequences.htm" data-mc-conditions="Primary.ScreenOnly">policy sequence</a> to determine the appropriate standard for each Component-Section.</li>
            <li>cycles through all of the Component-Sections in the inventory, and uses each Component-Section's standard to identify and generate necessary work items</li>
            <li><a href="../work_management/work_items/wm_prioritizing_work_items.htm">prioritizes the work items</a> for the current year using the selected <a href="../work_management/5_prioritization_schemes/wm_about_prioritization_schemes.htm" data-mc-conditions="Primary.ScreenOnly">prioritization scheme</a></li>

            <li>schedules completion of funded work items for later in the current year</li>
            <li>sets current date to the date scheduled for work item completion, and registers the effect of the work as follows: creates a condition assessment for the current date with appropriate findings, changes the Component-Section record if replaced or painted, and marks work item as completed</li>
            <li>sets current date to the end of the current year and calculate CIs for all Component-Sections, taking into account the appropriate prior <a href="javascript:void(0)" class="MCTextPopup MCTextPopupHotSpot MCTextPopup_Open glossaryTerm glossaryTermPopup MCTextPopupHotSpot_ MCTextPopupHotSpot_Popup" glossTerm="ESMS-gloss.Term1" xmlns:MadCap="http://www.madcapsoftware.com/Schemas/MadCap.xsd">CI<span class="MCTextPopupBody popupBody"><span class="MCTextPopupArrow"> </span>Condition Index</span></a><span class="MCTextPopupBody popupBody">Condition Index</span>, deterioration rate, and any work completed </li>
            <li><span class="result">after the previous steps have completed one simulated year:</span> advance the current date to the start of next year and go back to the first step until 10 years have been simulated, or the established length of the scenario specified in the set-up process</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This very simple outline of what Scenarios does shows that you will have to specify several key elements of the process before a scenario is able to move through these steps. They include the policy sequence, the prioritization scheme, and the funding levels. You will do this when you <a href="about_scenario_mgt.htm">manage a scenario</a>. The particular policy sequence you choose will affect what work is identified. The particular prioritization scheme you choose will affect which work items rank highest in a year's work plan. The particular funding levels you choose will affect the amount of work that can be accomplished in any given year. As you might imagine, scenarios in which different policy sequences, prioritization schemes, and/or funding levels are used will yield very different outcomes and can be compared and analyzed to determine the optimal work plan for your inventory.</p>
