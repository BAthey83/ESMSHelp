        <h3><a name="Scope"></a>Scope Tab</h3>
        <p>The <span class="span_1">Scope</span> tab, which displays when the "Edit Scenario" popup appears, specifies (1)&#160;the planning horizon (2)&#160;the Buildings to be included in the simulation, and (3)&#160;which Systems are to be included. </p>

            <li><span class="span_1">Select Organization/Site/Complex.</span> This is where you specify the Organization, Sites, and/or Complexes to be included in the simulation. The <span class="span_1">Available</span> column lists all of the Organizations, Sites, and Complexes currently in the inventory at your current location in the inventory tree. Available Complexes will include, at a minimum, the "Unassigned" Complex that contains all Buildings at the Site that are not specifically assigned to a named Complex. <br /><br />Use the arrow keys between the two columns to create, in the <span class="span_1">Selected</span> column, a list of inventory that is to be included in the simulation.

			<p class="indent"><span class="span_1">Note:</span> It is okay if there is overlap in the <span class="span_1">Selected</span> inventory; that is, if the same Building is in more than one of the groups in the <span class="span_1">Selected</span> list.</p></li>
            <li><span class="span_1">Systems to be included.</span> Starting with <span class="mc-variable Primary.Product variable">BUILDER</span> Version 3.6.4, all Systems will be included by default in the scenario unless you change this option here. To change, toggle the System checkboxes to select or one or more individual Systems. This selection will pertain to all Buildings selected. The ability to narrow down to a subset of Systems is especially useful if you are simply developing a long-term repair and replacement plan for a single System in one or more Buildings.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3><a name="General"></a>General Tab</h3>
        <p>The <span class="span_1">General</span> tab allows you to set the <span class="span_1">Cost Book</span>, <span class="span_1">Inflation Book</span>, <span class="span_1">Service (Life) Book</span>, <span class="span_1">Policy Sequence</span>, <span class="span_1">Prioritization Scheme</span>, and/or   <span class="span_1"><a href="../resources/terms/term-fci-gloss.htm" class="MCTopicPopup MCTopicPopupHotSpot MCTopicHotSpot_ MCTopicHotSpot_Popup #text #textPopup">FCI</a> Policy</span> options to use for the scenario. </p>
        <p>The default for each of the options listed above is the setting  that has been specified at <span class="span_1">Tools &gt; Library</span> and in <span class="span_1">Work Configuration</span> for the associated Organization, Site, or the parent of any Complex selected. Scenarios can be run even if the settings for some of the selected assets differ from other selected assets; however, work items from Scenarios cannot be copied into a work plan if the settings conflict with each other. </p>
        <p>Each option  is described in greater detail below, and values can be selected via dropdown as shown by example for the Service (Life) Book in the screenshot.</p>

        <p>A "<a href="javascript:void(0)" class="MCTextPopup MCTextPopupHotSpot MCTextPopup_Open MCTextPopupHotSpot_ #text">POM<img class="MCHelpControl_Image_Icon" src="../../Skins/Default/Stylesheets/Images/transparent_16x11.gif" alt="Closed" data-mc-alt2="Open" style="width: 16;height: 11;" /><span class="MCTextPopupBody popupBody"><span class="MCTextPopupArrow"> </span>Program Objectives Memorandum</span></a> Scenarios" feature   has been introduced that allows Facility Condition Index (<a href="../resources/terms/term-fci-gloss.htm" class="MCTopicPopup MCTopicPopupHotSpot MCTopicHotSpot_ MCTopicHotSpot_Popup #text #textPopup">FCI</a>) targets to be programmed into <span class="mc-variable Primary.Product variable">BUILDER</span> such that Scenarios can be configured to calculate the funding required to meet these targets.</p>
        <p>The name of the feature,  introduced in <span class="mc-variable Primary.Product variable">BUILDER</span> Version 3.5.0, is Scenarios Work Generation in Support of Program Objectives Memorandum (<a href="javascript:void(0)" class="MCTextPopup MCTextPopupHotSpot MCTextPopup_Open MCTextPopupHotSpot_ #text">POM<img class="MCHelpControl_Image_Icon" src="../../Skins/Default/Stylesheets/Images/transparent_16x11.gif" alt="Closed" data-mc-alt2="Open" style="width: 16;height: 11;" /><span class="MCTextPopupBody popupBody"><span class="MCTextPopupArrow"> </span>Program Objectives Memorandum</span></a>). </p>
        <p> This feature allows Scenarios to output the funding required to meet those <a href="../resources/terms/term-fci-gloss.htm" class="MCTopicPopup MCTopicPopupHotSpot MCTopicHotSpot_ MCTopicHotSpot_Popup #text #textPopup">FCI</a> targets, in addition to the recommended work actions. To do this, <a href="../resources/terms/term-fci-gloss.htm" class="MCTopicPopup MCTopicPopupHotSpot MCTopicHotSpot_ MCTopicHotSpot_Popup #text #textPopup">FCI</a> targets can be established alongside work configuration Policy settings. BUILDER Scenarios generates the recommended work candidates based on the user's work configuration settings (Policy Sequences / Prioritization) and then begins "funding" work items for each facility in priority order until the <a href="../resources/terms/term-fci-gloss.htm" class="MCTopicPopup MCTopicPopupHotSpot MCTopicHotSpot_ MCTopicHotSpot_Popup #text #textPopup">FCI</a> target is achieved.

        <h4>Funding Constraints</h4>
        <p>Independently of whether you choose the option to use <a href="../resources/terms/term-fci-gloss.htm" class="MCTopicPopup MCTopicPopupHotSpot MCTopicHotSpot_ MCTopicHotSpot_Popup #text #textPopup">FCI</a> objectives to generate the funding profile, you can choose  whether the scenario is to be constrained by funding or unconstrained by funding: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>If unconstrained, all simulated work items will be completed in the year they are generated.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>If constrained, you must specify the annual funding levels for all funding sources that were previously identified in <span class="mc-variable Primary35.Product variable">BUILDER</span> during the Work Configuration process. In a constrained scenario, work items and projects will be ranked by priority and funded for completion in order of rank until funds are exhausted. Work items and projects that are not funded cannot be completed. Projects and user-created work items that are not completed as planned will be carried over to the next year (see <a href="#Work" class="MCXref xref">Work Carryover Tab</a>).</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>When you have funding constraints, these will appear on the Scenarios popup at the <span class="span_1">Funding</span> tab in a grid showing funding sources and amounts. Select the checkbox next to each funding source that is to be used for the scenario. You may not delete a funding source in Scenarios, but you can edit the dollar amount or even set it to $0.  To do so, tap  (if touch is enabled) or click on the dollar amount and type in the replacement quantity, or use the up and down arrows. </p>
        <p>To activate or deactivate funding constraints, </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Select the <span class="span_1">Constrained</span> checkbox if funding is constrained. <p class="indent"><span class="span_1">Note:</span> If funding is unconstrained, the table of constraints will appear in gray color.</p></li>
            <li>If funding is constrained, select the checkbox next to each constraint in the table that applies to the scenario. To select all of the constraints, select the checkbox in the header row.</li>
            <li>You can use the <span class="span_1">Reset</span> button to the right of the <span class="span_1">Constrained</span> checkbox to clear all checkboxes in the constraints table, or you can select checkboxes to toggle them.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The constraints that appear in the table come from the data entered at the <span class="span_1">Expected Funds</span> tab in the Work Configuration process, which is performed by a user with Work Planner or higher permissions. </p>
        <h3><a name="Work"></a>Work Carryover Tab</h3>
        <p>Here you can make adjustments to work carried over due to funding constraints (see <a href="#Funding" class="MCXref xref">Funding Tab</a> for more about funding constraints).</p>
        <h3><a name="InvEvents"></a><a name="kanchor240"></a>Inventory Events Tab</h3>
        <p>At the <span class="span_1">Inventory Events</span> tab, future "whole building" events such as Current (Building) <a href="#Status" data-mc-conditions="Primary.ScreenOnly">Status changes</a> can be triggered at particular points in the simulation. In addition, completely <a href="#New" data-mc-conditions="Primary.ScreenOnly">new Buildings</a> ("New Inventory") can be dynamically added to the inventory during the simulation. Each of these capabilities is described in greater detail below.</p>
        <h4><a name="Status"></a>Status Changes</h4>
        <p>Buildings in the <span class="mc-variable Primary35.Product variable">BUILDER</span> inventory that have a Current Status that starts with "To be"  will have the implied effects of those status changes represented during the scenario. For example, if a Building has a status of "To be demolished" in year X, the Scenarios simulation will include the occurrence of the demolition in year X. In addition, you can schedule status changes in the scenario's parameters. This capability allows you to do the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="span_1">Add new Buildings</span> to the inventory dynamically as the scenario progresses. To do this, add the Buildings to the <span class="mc-variable Primary35.Product variable">BUILDER</span> inventory with a Current Status of "To be built" or "To be acquired," with an effective year equal to the year the status is to change to "Active." When the scenario time reaches that year, the status will be changed. At that point, the Building will be considered in the automated processes of condition assessment and work planning. If you wish to override the effective year of the status change as recorded in <span class="mc-variable Primary35.Product variable">BUILDER</span> inventory, in Scenarios you can enter a status change for the Building in the scenario for a different year.</li>
            <li><span class="span_1">Plan to demolish or transfer a Building</span> as the simulation progresses. You may do this in any of several ways: </li>
            <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
                <li value="1">Enter a Current Status of "To be demolished"/"To be transferred" in the <span class="mc-variable Primary35.Product variable">BUILDER</span> inventory, with an effective year set to the year the Building is to be removed, OR</li>
                <li value="2">Enter a scenario status change to "Demolished"/"Transferred" in the appropriate change year, OR</li>
                <li value="3">Enter a scenario status change to "To be demolished"/"To be transferred" in a chosen year. Note that this allows you to model the progression from (1) an active Building to (2) one that is to be demolished (accompanied perhaps by reduced maintenance standards) to (3) a demolished Building that is removed from work planning considerations.</li>
            </ol>
        </ul>
        <p>To initiate a status change in the simulation, activate the <span class="span_1">New</span> button in the Status Changes portion of the screen.</p>
        <p style="text-align: center;">
            <img src="imgsscenario/scen-inv-status-change-add-v3_6.png" alt="" />
        </p>
        <p>Next, select values from the dropdown lists for the following data elements in the "Inventory Change Event" popup that appears:</p>
        <ul>
            <ul>
                <li><span class="span_1">Building.</span> Select the Building for which the change in status applies.</li>
                <li><span class="span_1">New Status.</span> Select the new status of the Building using the dropdown list.</li>
                <li><span class="span_1">Change Year</span>. Enter the year in which the Building's status is to change to the new status.</li>
                <li><span class="span_1">Effective Year.</span> Enter the effective year of the new status.</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>
        <p>After making your selections, activate <span class="span_1">Create</span> at the bottom of the popup. Alternatively, activate <span class="span_1">Cancel</span> to return to the initial values shown.</p>
        <h4><a name="New"></a>New Inventory</h4>
        <p><span class="mc-variable Primary35.Product variable">BUILDER</span> allows you to add completely new Buildings during a scenario by activating the <span class="span_1">New</span> button in the New Inventory portion of the screen.</p>
        <p style="text-align: center;">
            <img src="imgsscenario/scen-new-inv-add-v3_6.png" alt="" />
        </p>
        <p>Next, enter the following data in the "Inventory New Event" popup: </p>
        <ul>
