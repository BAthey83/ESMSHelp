        <h1>Functionality Assessment Overview</h1>
        <p><a name="kanchor782"></a><span class="mc-variable Primary.Product variable" style="font-weight: bold;">BUILDER</span> has the ability to perform functional assessments on Buildings to measure their "functionality" state. The functionality state relates to the Building's suitability to function as intended and required for mission. The functionality state is distinct from, and determined independently from, the physical condition state that is evaluated using condition assessment. </p>
        <p>Although the functionality assessment is <span class="span_9" style="font-style: italic;">not</span> a detailed engineering assessment, it does satisfy the requirements necessary for routine Building facility management activities, including long range budgeting and modernization planning. It also helps to quickly identify problem areas that need more detailed assessments. There may be times when detailed engineering assessments may be required to diagnose specific problems.</p>
        <h2>Functionality Assessment Tiers</h2>
        <p>A functional assessment is structured according to a three-tiered, top-down approach that narrows the focus and is able to provide, at each lower level, greater assessment detail to the problem issues identified in the level above it. This approach saves effort, reduces cost, and focuses attention where needed. It also allows the process of identifying and developing modernization requirements to efficiently flow from a broad strategic planning phase to a detailed execution phase. The assessment approach encompasses the three levels shown below.</p>
        <p class="p_26" style="text-align: center;">
            <img src="../fa-imgs/functionality_l123.png" width="593" height="235" alt="" />
        </p>
        <p>In <span class="mc-variable Primary.Product variable">BUILDER</span><span class="mc-variable Primary.SystemVersion variable">3.6</span>, functionality assessments can be performed at the first and second tiers (Building and Functional Area levels). Later versions will include a third tier (Component-Section level) for functionality assessments.</p>
        <h3>First Tier Assessment: Building Level</h3>
        <p>The first tier of the functionality assessment is a fast, scoping Building-level assessment. <!--ajf xd 5/6/2015 Using a limited set of questions (see <a href="..\Issues_and_Subissues\FA_First_Tier_Functionality_Issues_and_Sub-Issues.htm">First Tier Functionality Issues and Sub-Issues</a><MadCap:keyword term="Building:Functionality Index" /><MadCap:keyword term="BFI" />) that address general functionality issues throughout the building, -->
		Using a limited set of questions (listed in <a href="../issues_and_subissues/fa_first_tier_functionality_issues_and_sub-issues.htm">First Tier Functionality Issues and Sub-Issues</a><a name="kanchor783"></a><a name="kanchor784"></a>) that address general functionality issues throughout the Building, the first tier provides a quick and accurate way to </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Rule out from further assessment issues that are not a problem, </li>
            <li>Identify issues that will require further assessment at the next tier level, and </li>
            <li>Compute the Building Functionality Index (<a href="javascript:void(0)" class="MCTextPopup MCTextPopupHotSpot MCTextPopup_Open glossaryTerm MCTextPopupHotSpot_" glossTerm="Primary.Term9" xmlns:MadCap="http://www.madcapsoftware.com/Schemas/MadCap.xsd">BFI<span class="MCTextPopupBody popupBody"><span class="MCTextPopupArrow"> </span>Building Functionality Index - computed from the results of a functionality assessment.</span></a><span class="MCTextPopupBody popupBody">Building Functionality Index - computed from the results of a functionality assessment.</span>). </li>
        </ul>
        <p>This level of assessment should be performed when an overall indication of the functionality of the Building is desired and when areas that will require further assessment need to be identified.
</p>
        <h3>Second Tier Assessment: Functional Area Level</h3>
        <p>The second tier of the functionality assessment is a methodical Building Functional Area assessment. This level of assessment produces more accurate results than the first tier, but it is also more time consuming and expensive to perform<!-- both --> because it is performed multiple times due to multiple Functional Areas<!--, and because the list of functionality questions is more extensive-->. In the second tier, a complete list of functionality questions (see <a href="../issues_and_subissues/fa_second_tier_functionality_issues_and_sub-issues.htm">Second Tier Functionality Issues and Sub-Issues</a>) is used to </p>
        <ol>
            <li value="1">Identify the specific functionality deficiencies in each Functional Area, </li>
            <li value="2">Compute the Functional Area Functionality Index, and </li>
            <li value="3">Refine the <a href="javascript:void(0)" class="MCTextPopup MCTextPopupHotSpot MCTextPopup_Open glossaryTerm MCTextPopupHotSpot_" glossTerm="Primary.Term9" xmlns:MadCap="http://www.madcapsoftware.com/Schemas/MadCap.xsd">BFI<span class="MCTextPopupBody popupBody"><span class="MCTextPopupArrow"> </span>Building Functionality Index - computed from the results of a functionality assessment.</span></a><span class="MCTextPopupBody popupBody">Building Functionality Index - computed from the results of a functionality assessment.</span>. </li>
        </ol>
        <p>This level of assessment should be used when the functionality deficiencies within Functional Areas need to be identified and when the results of the first tier need to be refined. </p>
        <h2>Functionality Assessment Sets</h2>
        <p>At any assessment tier level, when you create a new assessment, the <span class="mc-variable Primary.Product variable" style="font-weight: bold;">BUILDER</span> Functionality module will ask which type of Assessment Set to create. Each Assessment Set created represents a snapshot of the facility's functionality state of a certain type at a point in time. </p>
        <p>The following assessment sets are built in to <span class="mc-variable Primary.Product variable" style="font-weight: bold;">BUILDER</span> Version <span class="mc-variable Primary.SystemVersion variable">3.6</span>:</p>
        <ol>
            <li value="1"><span class="span_1" style="font-weight: bold;">Functionality</span>. This is the baseline assessment set in BUILDER.</li>
            <li value="2"><span class="span_1" style="font-weight: bold;">Cultural Resources</span>. </li>
            <li value="3"><span class="span_1"><a href="javascript:void(0)" class="MCTextPopup MCTextPopupHotSpot MCTextPopup_Open glossaryTerm glossaryTermPopup MCTextPopupHotSpot_ MCTextPopupHotSpot_Popup" glossTerm="Primary.Term36" xmlns:MadCap="http://www.madcapsoftware.com/Schemas/MadCap.xsd">HPSB<span class="MCTextPopupBody popupBody"><span class="MCTextPopupArrow"> </span>High Performance and Sustainable Building</span></a><span class="MCTextPopupBody popupBody">High Performance and Sustainable Building</span> Facility</span>. This assessment set, High Performance and Sustainable Building, examines the area of energy efficiency.</li>
        </ol>
        <p> These assessment sets can be created and assessed at either the Building or Functional Area tier (first or second tier). </p>

        <p>It is important to note that the <a href="javascript:void(0)" class="MCTextPopup MCTextPopupHotSpot MCTextPopup_Open glossaryTerm glossaryTermPopup MCTextPopupHotSpot_ MCTextPopupHotSpot_Popup" glossTerm="ESMS-gloss.Term5" xmlns:MadCap="http://www.madcapsoftware.com/Schemas/MadCap.xsd">FI<span class="MCTextPopupBody popupBody"><span class="MCTextPopupArrow"> </span>Functionality Index</span></a><span class="MCTextPopupBody popupBody">Functionality Index</span> metrics are step functions over time, unlike the smooth, continuous functions seen in BUILDER's condition indices. This is because functionality, unlike condition, is not an ongoing process. The functionality of a Building or of a Functional Area depends on user needs, technical obsolescence, and compliance with code or regulations. These factors do not change gradually, but rather at discrete points in time. These discrete changes are reflected in the “steps” in the <a href="javascript:void(0)" class="MCTextPopup MCTextPopupHotSpot MCTextPopup_Open glossaryTerm glossaryTermPopup MCTextPopupHotSpot_ MCTextPopupHotSpot_Popup" glossTerm="ESMS-gloss.Term5" xmlns:MadCap="http://www.madcapsoftware.com/Schemas/MadCap.xsd">FI<span class="MCTextPopupBody popupBody"><span class="MCTextPopupArrow"> </span>Functionality Index</span></a><span class="MCTextPopupBody popupBody">Functionality Index</span> over time.

        </p>
        <h3>Functionality / Condition / Performance Index</h3>
        <p>The functionality index is one of two indexes used to calculate another index called the <span class="new-term" style="font-style: italic;">performance index</span> (the other contributing index is the condition index). The performance index is what determines the color (green, amber, or red) shown for an inventory asset. </p>
        <p>In a nutshell, <span class="mc-variable Primary35.Product variable" style="font-weight: bold;">BUILDER</span> calculates the performance index by first collecting the condition index value and the functionality index value applicable to the target inventory asset. Next, the lower index value is multiplied by 60 percent and the higher index value is multiplied by 40 percent. Finally, the two numbers are added together to determine the performance index value for that inventory asset.</p>
        <p class="indent"><span class="span_1" style="font-weight: bold;">Note:</span> Until a functionality assessment is performed on a Building, the functionality index for that Building is 100 percent by default.</p>
