        <h1><a name="kanchor741"></a>Egress Checklist</h1>
        <p>Included below is a checklist of the major requirements of the 2003 International Building Code (IBC) Chapter 10 "Means of Egress." This checklist is intended to be used as a reference, not as the governing document, when comparing a Building (or Functional Area) against egress requirements. For the complete text and requirements of the chapter, see the 2003 IBC.</p>
        <p>To answer each of the questions in the checklist, check if each requirement of each question (described below) is met. If all of the requirements are met, mark the <span class="span_1">Compliant</span> radio button next to the question in the <MadCapconditionalText data-mc-conditions="Primary.36"><a href="../../functionality-group/fa_funct_wizards.htm#Egress" class="MCXref xref">Egress Wizard</a></MadCapconditionalText>. If one or more of requirements are not met, mark the <span class="span_1">Non-Compliant</span> radio button next to the question in the Egress Wizard. If a question does not apply to the Building (or Functional Area), mark the <span class="span_1">N/A</span> radio button.</p>
        <p>In some of the questions below, the IBC occupancy classification, or type, is referenced. Below is a table that describes the type of Buildings belonging to each type. Care should be taken when determining the occupancy type of the Building you are assessing. Consult the latest copy of IBC if you are unsure.</p>
        <p class="p_26" style="text-align: center;">
            <img src="egress_check7.png" width="343" height="207" border="0" alt="" />
        </p>
        <p>Some of the occupancy types have multiple sub-occupancy types (ex: A-1, A-2, A-3, A-4, &amp; A-5 for occupancy type A), which are referenced below. If necessary, consult the 2003 IBC to determine the specific sub-occupancy type of your Building (or Functional Area).</p>
