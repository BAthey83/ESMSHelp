        <h1><a name="kanchor76"></a>Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) Checklist</h1>
        <p>Included below is a checklist of the major requirements in the Department of Justice's ADA Standards for Accessible Design. This checklist is intended to be used as a reference, not as the governing document, when comparing a Building against the standards. For the complete version of the ADA standards, see http://www.usdoj.gov/crt/ada/adastd94.pdf.</p>
        <p>To answer each of the questions in the checklist, the sub-questions of the question must be answered first. If all of the sub-questions are answered "Yes," then the question is also answered as "Yes." For questions answered "Yes," mark the <span class="span_1" style="font-weight: bold;">Compliant</span> radio button in the <a href="../old-v3_5/ada/fa_ada_wizard.htm" class="MCXref xref">Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) Wizard</a>. If one or more of the sub-questions are answered "No," the question is also answered "No" and the <span class="span_1">Non-Compliant</span> radio button is marked in the ADA Wizard. If a particular question does not apply to the Building (or Functional Area), mark the <span class="span_1" style="font-weight: bold;">N/A</span> radio button.</p>
