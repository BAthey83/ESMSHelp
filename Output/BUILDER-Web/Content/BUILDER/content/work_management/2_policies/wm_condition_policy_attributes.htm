        <h1><a name="kanchor663"></a>About Condition Policy Attributes</h1>
        <hr width="100%" size="0" align="center" /><a name="kanchor664"></a>
        <p>This topic lists the inventory item attributes that can be selected from when setting up work management policies and explains how to use them alone or in combination.</p>
        <hr width="100%" size="0" align="center" />
        <p>A condition policy can be based on any one, two, three, or four attributes pertaining to the inventory item(s) that will be evaluated by the policy. If you are creating a policy containing more than one attribute, be sure to familiarize with the section <a href="#Combining" class="MCXref xref">About Combining Condition Policy Attributes</a>. </p>
        <p>Some of the attributes shown in the dropdown list will have characteristics and options that make them similar but not identical to one or more other attributes. This is because the attribute options have been customized for different user groups with similar but not identical inventory groupings and analysis needs.</p>
        <p class="indent"><span class="span_1">Note:</span> It might not be necessary to designate a standard for each and every value range listed for your selected attributes. In Policy Sequences, a default condition standard is set for items that do not have a condition standard set for them in a policy. If a <span class="span_1">Standard</span> field is left blank, the default standard specified under Policy Sequences will be used.</p>
        <h2>Available Policy Attributes</h2>
        <p>The same policy attributes are available for condition policy attributes and for <a href="wm_functionality_policy_attributes.htm">functionality policy attributes</a>, but the examples given may differ.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><a name="kanchor665"></a><span class="span_1">Building Construction Type.</span> When you select this attribute, you will be presented with the four Building Construction Types: "Permanent," "Semipermanent," "Temporary," and Leased." Using the dropdown lists in the <span class="span_1">Standard</span> column, designate a condition standard for each. <a href="javascript:void(0)" class="MCTextPopup popup popupHead">Example<span class="MCTextPopupBody MCTextPopupBody_Closed needs-pie popupBody" aria-hidden="true">An example of setting up a condition policy based on this attribute is the case where you want to set a lower condition standard for Component-Sections in a temporary Building or facility.</span></a></li>
            <li><a name="kanchor666"></a><span class="span_1">Building Historic.</span>  When you select this attribute, you will be presented with "True" and "False." Using the dropdown lists in the <span class="span_1">Standard</span> column, designate a condition standard for each. <a href="javascript:void(0)" class="MCTextPopup popup popupHead">Example<span class="MCTextPopupBody MCTextPopupBody_Closed needs-pie popupBody" aria-hidden="true">An example of setting up a condition policy based on this attribute is the case where you want to set the condition standard to High or Elevated for Component-Sections in a historic building.</span></a></li>
            <li><a name="kanchor667"></a><span class="span_1">Building Number of Floors.</span>  When you select this attribute, you will be presented with an entry form divided into the following categories: "1 Floor," "2 Floors," "3 Floors," "4 Floors," "5 to 10 Floors," and "More than 10 Floors." Using the dropdown lists in the <span class="span_1">Standard</span> column, designate a condition standard for each category desired. If a <span class="span_1">Standard</span> field is left blank, the default standard specified under Policy Sequences will be used. <a href="javascript:void(0)" class="MCTextPopup popup popupHead">Example<span class="MCTextPopupBody MCTextPopupBody_Closed needs-pie popupBody" aria-hidden="true">An example of setting up a condition policy using this attribute is the case where you might want to designate a higher condition standard for fire protection systems in buildings more than two stories high.</span></a></li>
            <!--          <li><span class="result">, by combining two attributes, "Building Number of Floors" and "Component"</span> <span class="span_1">***engineer help me out here, tnx.</span>AF consider making this an example of combining attributes. (tb continue in Policy Sequences)</li> -->
            <li><a name="kanchor668"></a><span class="span_1">Building Type.</span> When you select this attribute, you will be presented with a listing of various building frame types such as "Concrete Shear Walls" and "Steel Light Frame." Using the dropdown lists in the <span class="span_1">Standard</span> column, designate a condition standard for each. <a href="javascript:void(0)" class="MCTextPopup popup popupHead">Example<span class="MCTextPopupBody MCTextPopupBody_Closed needs-pie popupBody" aria-hidden="true">An example of setting up a condition policy using this attribute is the case where you want to maintain the fire protection System in a wood frame Building ("Wood, Commercial and Industrial" and "Wood, Light Frame") to a higher standard than in other Buildings.</span></a></li>
            <li><a name="BUC"></a><a name="kanchor669"></a><span class="span_1">Building Use Category.</span>  When you select this attribute, you will be presented with a listing of Building Use Categories. The broad categories listed here are those with one-digit category codes, the Building Functionality Group. Using the dropdown lists in the <span class="span_1">Standard</span> column, designate a condition standard for each category desired. <a href="javascript:void(0)" class="MCTextPopup popup popupHead">Example<span class="MCTextPopupBody MCTextPopupBody_Closed needs-pie popupBody" aria-hidden="true">An example of setting up a condition policy based on this attribute is the case where you want medical Buildings to be maintained at an Elevated condition standard, whereas supply structures such as warehouses can be maintained at a lower condition standard. If you wish to identify Building Use more specifically, you can use a different attribute such as Facility Category Code or Facility Use (CatCode). Each of these is described further below in this list. This example is fleshed out in more detail in &amp;lt;MadCap:xref href="WM_Example_Condition_Policy_Setup.htm"&amp;gt;Examples of Condition Policy Setup&amp;lt;/MadCap:xref&amp;gt;. </span></a></li>
            <li><a name="kanchor670"></a><span class="span_1">Building Vacant.</span>  When you select this attribute, you will be presented with "True" and "False." Using the dropdown lists in the <span class="span_1">Standard</span> column, designate a condition standard for each. <a href="javascript:void(0)" class="MCTextPopup popup popupHead">Example<span class="MCTextPopupBody MCTextPopupBody_Closed needs-pie popupBody" aria-hidden="true">An example of setting up a condition policy based on this attribute is the case where you want to maintain a vacant Building at a lower standard than one that is occupied.
</span></a></li>
            <li><a name="kanchor671"></a><span class="span_1">Building Year Constructed.</span>  When you select this attribute, you will be presented with tiers describing the Building's year of construction (ten years per tier, plus "Before 1900" and "Unknown"). Using the dropdown lists in the <span class="span_1">Standard</span> column, designate a condition standard for each. <a href="javascript:void(0)" class="MCTextPopup popup popupHead">Example<span class="MCTextPopupBody MCTextPopupBody_Closed needs-pie popupBody" aria-hidden="true">An example of setting up a condition policy based on this attribute is the case where you decide to maintain progressively older Buildings at progressively lower standard levels.

            <li><span class="span_1"><a name="kanchor673"></a>Component.</span> This attribute allows you to specify a standard for each Component available to the program. When you select "Component" as one of your attributes, you will be presented with a long list of Components. Each line shows the number (in UNIFORMAT II format) and name of a Component. Using the dropdown lists in the <span class="span_1">Standard</span> column, designate a condition standard for each Component desired. <p class="indent"><span class="span_1">Tip:</span> A time-saving measure to consider is to use <span class="span_1">System</span> as one of your attributes, and then to designate a standard here only for those Components whose standard should differ from the standard set for the <span class="span_1">System</span> they are in.</p><p class="indent"><span class="span_1">Note:</span> You can find a table showing UNIFORMAT II Component ("Level 3") numbers in the Inventory section of the documentation, <MadCapconditionalText data-mc-conditions="Primary.ScreenOnly">at <a href="../../inventory/systems,_components,_and_sections/systems/inv_builder_systems-table.htm" class="MCXref xref">BUILDER Systems and Components</a>. </MadCapconditionalText>In the PDF documentation, refer to the <span class="ref-title">BUILDER Inventory Guide</span>, Version 3.5.2 or later.</p></li>

        <h2><a name="Combining"></a>About Combining Condition Policy Attributes</h2>
        <p>When you use more than one attribute to define a policy, <span class="mc-variable Primary.Product variable">BUILDER</span> will construct a grid that takes into account all possible combinations of the attributes selected for the policy. The number of options in the grid will be the result of multiplying the number of options available for each attribute selected in the policy. For example, 21 (number of <span class="span_1">Systems</span>) x 6 (number of options for <span class="span_1">Building Number of Floors</span> x 2 (a True/False attribute) = 252 grid options. </p>
        <p>You can see how additional attribute selections—especially those with a large number of options—can amplify the size of the grid you will need to deal with when applying standards to the desired combinations of options, so be careful in designing your policy.</p>
        <li>When applying standards, you will rarely need to select a condition standard for every possible combination of options. Combinations for which no condition standard is specified are simply not dictated by the policy; the default standard defined at <a href="../3_policy-sequences/wm_about_policy_sequences.htm">Policy Sequences</a> will be applied.</li>
        <p>Instructions for combining condition policy attributes can be found at <a href="wm_add_condition_policy.htm#Policy2" class="MCXref xref">Policy Using Multiple Attributes</a> in the topic <a href="wm_add_condition_policy.htm" class="MCXref xref">Add a Condition Policy</a>.</p>
