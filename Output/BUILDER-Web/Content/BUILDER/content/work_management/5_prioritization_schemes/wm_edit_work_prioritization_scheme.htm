        <h1><a name="kanchor819"></a>Edit a Work Prioritization Scheme</h1>
        <p class="indent"><span class="span_1">Note:</span> In addition to setting work priorities using one or more prioritization schemes, there is another option available that can be used in addition to prioritization schemes. Namely, in the work plan table at the <span class="span_1"><a href="javascript:void(0)" class="MCTextPopup MCTextPopupHotSpot MCTextPopup_Open MCTextPopupHotSpot_ #text">Work Plan<img class="MCHelpControl_Image_Icon" src="../../../Skins/Default/Stylesheets/Images/transparent_16x11.gif" alt="Closed" data-mc-alt2="Open" style="width: 16;height: 11;" /><span class="MCTextPopupBody popupBody"><span class="MCTextPopupArrow"> </span>A multi-year collection of work items and/or projects planned for a Site or Organization.  Provided by Mike Grussing to AJF in email June 17, 2019.</span></a> Items</span> tab, you can mark the checkbox in the <span class="span_1">Must Do</span> column. This forces the corresponding work activity to be funded before all other competing work items that are not marked as "Must do."</p>
        <p>If you have constructed a work plan<a name="kanchor820"></a><a name="kanchor821"></a><a name="kanchor822"></a><a name="kanchor823"></a> for a given year, you will need to prioritize it so that your planning efforts and funding allocations can be directed to the most important items. <span class="mc-variable Primary.Product variable">BUILDER</span> allows you to do this using a work prioritization scheme. The <span class="mc-variable Primary.Product variable">BUILDER</span> work prioritization method uses a simple additive utility function to calculate a score for each work item and to rank the work items from highest score (most important) to lowest (least important). It does this by allowing you to outline and weight your objectives and to identify specific properties of the work item that can be used as measures of how well a work item meets a particular objective. With a work prioritization scheme that you have tested and calibrated, you will be able to prioritize and rank your work plan in a quick, objective, repeatable, and representative method with the touch of a button.</p>
        <p>To create or edit a prioritization scheme, select <span class="span_1">Work Configuration &gt;  Prioritization Schemes</span> starting at the main menu.</p>
        <p class="p_26" data-mc-conditions="Primary.Builder">
            <img src="work_conf_prior_schemes2_750x450.png" alt="" style="width: 750;height: 450;" />
        </p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p><span class="result">The Prioritization Schemes screen will appear.</span>
        </p>
        <p class="p_26">
            <img src="prior_scheme_window.png" alt="" />
        </p>
        <p>For a description of the prioritization scheme shown above, see the <a href="wm_prioritization_example.htm">Prioritization Example</a>. The prioritization example also includes an example scoring of a work item using the example shown.</p>
        <h3>Toolbar Options</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="span_1">Return</span>. Closes the Prioritization Scheme window.</li>
            <li><span class="span_1">Save</span>. Saves changes made to the prioritization schemes. </li>
            <li><span class="span_1">Add</span>. Initiates adding a new prioritization scheme.</li>
            <li><span class="span_1">Delete</span>. Deletes the selected prioritization scheme.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Add a Prioritization Scheme</h2>
        <p>You can create as many prioritization schemes as you like. When you are ready to prioritize a work plan, you will simply select, in the Reference Settings area at the Site or Organization's <span class="span_1">General Information</span> tab, the prioritization scheme you wish to use. You may, in fact, wish to try out several different schemes and then compare the resulting prioritized lists. </p>
        <p>To create a new prioritization scheme, </p>
        <ol>
            <li value="1">Activate <span class="span_1">Add Scheme</span> on the window toolbar. 
				<p class="p_26"><img src="../../bld/adding_scheme.png" alt="" /></p><p>&#160;</p><p><span class="result">The "New Prioritization Scheme" popup window will appear.</span></p><p class="p_26"><img src="copy_existing_prior_scheme_433x234.png" alt="" style="width: 433;height: 234;" /></p></li>
            <li value="2"><a name="kanchor824"></a>Enter a unique name for the new scheme, which is limited to 50 alphanumeric characters.</li>
            <p class="indent"><span class="span_1">Note:</span> You may wish to keep the name much shorter than the allowed 50 characters in order to minimize wraparound in the name when it's displayed in the tree.</p>
            <li value="3">Activate <span class="span_1">Add</span> on the toolbar.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Initially after creating a prioritization scheme, only the Main Objective will appear in the scheme. The main objective can be reworded (see <span class="span_1">Editing an Objective</span> below) and subobjectives can be added to it (See <span class="span_1">Adding a Subobjective</span> below)</p>
        <p>Note that when you are creating a new prioritization scheme you have the option to copy an existing scheme. If you have a prioritization scheme that you have fine tuned and accept as the standard scheme to use, then the ability to copy it can be very useful. If you want to experiment with recalibration of the weights and measures, you can do so with a copy and not destroy your original values. To copy an existing scheme, mark the <span class="span_1">Copy an Existing Prioritization Scheme</span> checkbox, select the scheme to copy from the dropdown list, and activate <span class="span_1">Add</span> on the toolbar.</p>
        <p>Additionally, there is no way to cancel changes for prioritization schemes. Changes are saved to the database when they are made, and the changes overwrite previous data. A safe way to experiment with a particular prioritization scheme is to copy it by creating an entirely new scheme and then edit with the copy and leave the original alone.</p>
        <h3><span class="span_1">Add a Subobjective</span>
        </h3>
        <p>To add a subobjective to an objective on the tree, </p>
        <ol>
            <li value="1">Select the objective.</li>
            <li value="2">Activate <span class="span_1">Add Measure</span> on the content screen toolbar.</li>
            <!-- right-click doesn't seem to be working -ajf -1-11-2016: <li>right-click it, and select "Add Subobjective".</li> -->
        </ol>
        <p class="p_26">
            <img src="add_measure_prior_scheme.png" alt="" />
        </p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p><span class="result">The "New SubObjective" popup window will appear:</span>

        <p class="p_26">
            <img src="subobjective_name_522x407.png" alt="" style="width: 522;height: 407;" />
        </p>
        <p>To create the subobjective, the following data must be recorded:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="span_1">Node name.</span> Enter the name of the objective that will appear in the tree.</li>
            <li><span class="span_1">Measure Type. </span>Select the type of objective to be created from the three available types:</li>
            <ul>
                <li><span class="span_1">Fundamental Objective.</span><span class="span_2"> This is a statement of one of the things you are trying to accomplish with the work plan. It is primarily used to help you outline your thoughts so that you eventually are able to identify properties (measures) in your inventory that you will consider when prioritizing the individual work items.</span>
                </li>
                <li><span class="span_1">Measure.</span> A measure is a property of the work item or of the inventory hierarchy of the work item's Component-Section. A work item's overall score in the prioritization scheme is fundamentally determined by the values of the work item's properties that are used as measures in the scheme, the point values assigned to those particular values, and the relative weights of the objectives.</li>
                <li><span class="span_1">Category Split</span>. See <span class="span_1">Using Category Splits</span> below for a further description of category splits.</li>
            </ul>
            <li><span class="span_1">Measure/Split Category</span><a name="kanchor825"></a>. If you select "Measure" or "Category Split" as the type of objective, select the category to associate with the measure or split, either Building or General. If a fundamental objective is selected as the measure type, this field will not appear. </li>
            <li><span class="span_1">Available Measures</span>. If you select "Measure" or "Category Split" as the type for this objective, then you will also have to select the measure to associate the measure or split. The available measures in the dropdown list depends on the  Category Split or Measure category chosen. If a fundamental objective is selected as the measure type, this field will not appear. </li>
        </ul>
        <p>In addition to this required data, you have the option to add a Description of the new objective, which is limited to 255 alphanumeric characters. When all of the information has been entered, activate the <span class="span_1">Proceed</span> button to create the objective. If you do not wish to create the objective, activate the <span class="span_1">Cancel</span> button.</p>
        <h3>Delete an Objective </h3>
        <p>To delete an objective from the tree: </p>
        <ol>
            <li value="1">Select the objective on the tree. </li>
            <li value="2">Activate the <span class="span_1">Delete</span> button.</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="p_26">
            <img src="delete_prior_scheme_name.png" alt="" />
        </p>
        <p>It is important to note that if you delete an objective, the entire subtree under the objective will be deleted as well.</p>
        <h3>Edit an Objective</h3>
        <p>To edit the name or description of an objective: </p>
        <ol>
            <li value="1">Select the objective on the tree.</li>
            <li value="2">Activate the <span class="span_1">Edit</span> button. </li>
        </ol>
        <p class="p_26">
            <img src="edit_measure_prior_scheme.png" alt="" />
        </p>
        <p>It is important to note that once an objective is created, you may not change the measure type, category, or measure itself, but you can change the node name.</p>
        <h4>Evaluate a Fundamental Objective</h4>
        <p>To record the relative weights of the children of an fundamental objective, select the fundamental objective, select it, and activate the <span class="span_1">Evaluate</span> button.</p>
        <p class="p_26">
            <img src="prior_scheme_evaluate2.png" alt="" />
        </p>
        <p>The Objective window will appear:</p>
        <p class="p_26">
            <img src="objective_window.png" alt="" />
        </p>
        <p>The children of the fundamental objective will be listed in a grid along with their weight. The default setting for the <span class="span_1">Weight</span> is 100 for all children. That is, all children are equally important to the parent. You may adjust the weights by doing one of the following:</p>
        <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
            <li value="1">Enter a number between 0 and 100 in the <span class="span_1">Weight</span> column.</li>
            <li value="2">Or, mark the <span class="span_1">Use Analytic Hierarchy Process</span> checkbox, then activate the <span class="span_1">Edit AHP Analysis</span> button. The AHP process allows you to establish the weights by doing a binary comparison of the field values. See <a href="../wm_using_the_analytic_hierarchy_process.htm" class="MCXref xref">Using the Analytic Hierarchy Process</a> for a description of this method.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Make sure to activate the <span class="span_1">Save</span> button to save changes.</p>
        <p class="indent"><span class="span_1">Note:</span> Each of these methods results in a normalized weight (which cannot be edited) that is calculated so that the sum of the weights is 100%. This is done by dividing each of the individual weights by the sum of all of the weights. </p>
        <h4><span class="span_1">Evaluate a Measure</span>
        </h4>
        <p>To assign points to the various values of a measure, select the measure, and then activate the <span class="span_1">Evaluate</span> button.</p>
        <p class="p_26">
            <img src="prior_scheme_evaluate.png" alt="" />
        </p>
        <p>The Measure Evaluation window will appear:</p>
        <p class="p_26">
            <img src="objective_weighting.png" alt="" />
        </p>
        <p>The possible field values for the measure will be listed in a grid, along with their assigned Point Value. The default point value is 100 for all field values. That is,  initially they are equally important. You can edit the point value to adjust the weights by doing one of the following:</p>
        <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
            <li value="1">Enter a number between 0 and 100 in the <span class="span_1">Weight</span> column.</li>

        <h4><a name="Using_Category_Splits"></a>About Using Category Splits</h4>
        <p>A category split, denoted by the <img src="split_19x16.gif" border="0" class="img_2" alt="" style="width: 19;height: 16;" /> icon in the Objectives Tree, is associated with a field property in the work item hierarchy and is used when you want to vary how the priority score is computed based on the work item's value for this field property. The subobjectives of a split can only be the various values of the field property. </p>
        <p>The subobjectives of a split are called categories. The categories identify which subtree will be used based on the associated field's property value. When the algorithm that calculates the score comes to a split, only the single branch of the tree under the split corresponding to the work item's property value as a category will be used. The screen below shows an example of a split in a prioritization scheme:</p>
        <p class="p_26">
            <img src="prior_scheme_test_split_700x450.jpg" alt="" style="width: 700;height: 450;" />
        </p>
        <p>The category split in this example is Type of Work. The associated field is work activity, which has 6 possible values: "Repair," "Replace," "Paint," "Remove," "Add/Install," and "Alter." A category split generally has an added category named "Otherwise," which is the branch of the tree used if the value of the field differs from all of the other listed values. In this case, "Remove," "Add/Install," and "Alter" will use the "Otherwise" category.<!-- huh? --> When you first create a split, all of the possible values of the field are listed as categories under it. If you delete a category, then items with that field property value will use the "Otherwise" category.</p>
        <p>In the example above, the work item's <a href="javascript:void(0)" class="MCTextPopup MCTextPopupHotSpot MCTextPopup_Open MCTextPopupHotSpot_ MCTextPopupHotSpot_Popup #text #textPopup">CI<img class="MCHelpControl_Image_Icon" src="../../../Skins/Default/Stylesheets/Images/transparent_16x11.gif" alt="Closed" data-mc-alt2="Open" style="width: 16;height: 11;" /><span class="MCTextPopupBody popupBody"><span class="MCTextPopupArrow"> </span>Condition Index</span></a> and <a href="javascript:void(0)" class="MCTextPopup MCTextPopupHotSpot MCTextPopup_Open MCTextPopupHotSpot_ MCTextPopupHotSpot_Popup #text #textPopup">RSL<img class="MCHelpControl_Image_Icon" src="../../../Skins/Default/Stylesheets/Images/transparent_16x11.gif" alt="Closed" data-mc-alt2="Open" style="width: 16;height: 11;" /><span class="MCTextPopupBody popupBody"><span class="MCTextPopupArrow"> </span>Remaining Service Life</span></a> are used as the measures for both "Repair" and "Replace." However, the point values assigned to the fields varies by type of work. To replace a Component-Section, the most cost-effective time would be indicated by a very low <a href="javascript:void(0)" class="MCTextPopup MCTextPopupHotSpot MCTextPopup_Open MCTextPopupHotSpot_ MCTextPopupHotSpot_Popup #text #textPopup">CI<img class="MCHelpControl_Image_Icon" src="../../../Skins/Default/Stylesheets/Images/transparent_16x11.gif" alt="Closed" data-mc-alt2="Open" style="width: 16;height: 11;" /><span class="MCTextPopupBody popupBody"><span class="MCTextPopupArrow"> </span>Condition Index</span></a> and little or no remaining service life. To repair a Component-Section, the most cost-effective time would be indicated by a mid-range <a href="javascript:void(0)" class="MCTextPopup MCTextPopupHotSpot MCTextPopup_Open MCTextPopupHotSpot_ MCTextPopupHotSpot_Popup #text #textPopup">CI<img class="MCHelpControl_Image_Icon" src="../../../Skins/Default/Stylesheets/Images/transparent_16x11.gif" alt="Closed" data-mc-alt2="Open" style="width: 16;height: 11;" /><span class="MCTextPopupBody popupBody"><span class="MCTextPopupArrow"> </span>Condition Index</span></a> and a long remaining service life. The Type of Work split allows the computation of the score to proceed selectively. Since only one of the categories will be used, the relative weights of the categories under a split are calculated differently from other types of objectives.</p>
        <p>To assign points to the various values of a split, navigate to the split on the tree, select it, and activate the <span class="span_1">Evaluate</span> button.</p>
        <p class="p_26">
            <img src="prior_scheme_test_split_2.png" alt="" />
        </p>
        <p>The "Measure Scores" popup window will appear:</p>
        <p class="p_26">
            <img src="objective_weighting2.png" alt="" />
        </p>
        <p>The possible field values for the measure will be listed in a grid, along with their assigned Point Value. The default point value is 50 for all field values. That is,  initially they are equally important. You can edit the point value to adjust the weights by doing one of the following:</p>
        <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
            <li value="1">Enter a number between 0 and 100 in the <span class="span_1">Weight</span> column.</li>
            <li value="2">Alternatively, if the number of field values is less than 25, mark the <span class="span_1">Use Analytic Hierarchy Process</span> checkbox, then activate the <span class="span_1">Edit AHP Analysis</span> button. The AHP process allows you to establish the weights by doing a binary comparison of the field values. See <MadCap:conditionalText data-mc-conditions="Primary.ScreenOnly"><a href="../wm_using_the_analytic_hierarchy_process.htm" class="MCXref xref">Using the Analytic Hierarchy Process</a></MadCap:conditionalText> for a description of this method.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Use the <span class="span_1">Save</span> button to save changes or the <span class="span_1">Cancel</span> button to return to the previously saved weights.</p>
        <p class="indent"><span class="span_1">Note:</span> Each of these methods results in a normalized weight (which cannot be edited) that is calculated so that the sum of the weights is 100%. This is done by dividing each of the individual weights by the sum of all of the weights. </p>
