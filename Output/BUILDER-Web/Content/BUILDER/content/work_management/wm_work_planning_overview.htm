        <h1><a name="kanchor317"></a>Work Planning Overview</h1>
        <hr width="100%" size="0" align="center" />
        <p>This work planning overview lays out the interrelationship between the work items, (optional) work projects, and work plans needed for successful work management.</p>
        <hr width="100%" size="0" align="center" />
        <p>After work configuration standards, policies, and policy sequences have been established in the <a href="standards,_policies,_and_policy_sequences/wm_standards,_policies,_and_policy_sequences_overview.htm" data-mc-conditions="Primary.ScreenOnly">work configuration</a> phase, you can use BUILDER's automated processes to generate a work plan. A work plan is a collection of work items planned for a Building, Site, or Organization. After a work plan has been auto-generated, you also have the option to manually create work items. </p>
        <p class="indent"><span class="span_1">Note:</span> You can't manually create a work item until after BUILDER has generated a work plan.</p>
        <h2>Definitions</h2>
        <h3><a name="Work"></a><a name="kanchor318"></a>Work Item</h3>
        <p>A work item is a discrete work activity applied to a single managed object and intended to improve its life cycle performance. The "managed object" is most typically a Component-Section, but it can also be a group of work items called a <a href="#Work2">work project</a>, which is described separately below.</p>
        <p>There are multiple ways that work items can come into being:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Work items can be created by BUILDER's automated work generator, using (1)&#160;thresholds defined in work configuration standards, (2)&#160;policies governing what standards to apply to which types of assets, and (3)&#160;policy sequences that determine the priority order in which the policies are applied. These are described in <MadCapconditionalText data-mc-conditions="Primary.ScreenOnly">the section of documentation starting with the topic <a href="standards,_policies,_and_policy_sequences/wm_standards,_policies,_and_policy_sequences_overview.htm" class="MCXref xref">Work Configuration Overview</a>.</MadCapconditionalText><span class="ref-title"></span></li>
            <li>A work item can be manually generated.</li>
            <li>Work items can be copied into a work plan from a scenario. </li>
        </ul>
        <h3><a name="Work2"></a><a name="kanchor319"></a>Work Project</h3>
        <!--AJF confirmed with Matt Walters on Friday, Jan 10 2020 that it is permissible to explicitly refer to a work project as a work ITEM type -->
        <p>A work project is a work item type that allows you to group other work items together and manage them as a single work effort that is prioritized and funded as a whole. The work items selected for the work project need not be in the same System or even in the same Building. An example of a work project would be a renovation effort that affects multiple Systems in a Building. A work project is the most customizable level of work item organization.</p>
        <h3><a name="kanchor320"></a>Work Plan</h3>
        <p>A work plan is a collection of work items and/or work projects planned within a designated scope. The scope of a work plan will be all of the work items pertaining to a particular Building, Complex, Site, or Organization.</p>
        <h2>What's Involved in Work Planning?</h2>
        <p>The automated processes use condition assessment data to plan maintenance and repair work at the Component-Section level, and they use functionality assessment data to plan modernization work at the Building or Functional Area level. </p>
        <!-- With your Building inventory, condition assessment, and functionality data in place, you can begin to truly manage the work in your Building using BUILDER's powerful tools. /p> -->
        <p>Work planning will consist of: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Prioritizing the work items for funding using tools such as BUILDER's standards, policies, and policy sequences, which are found under the <span class="span_1">Work Configuration</span> main menu item. This preparation process is what allows BUILDER to automatically generate appropriate work items.</li>
            <li>Creating work items. As mentioned in the <a href="#Work">definition of a work item</a>, this can be accomplished by (a) automation, (b) manual addition of work items, or (c)&#160;import from a scenario.</li>
            <li>(Optional) Grouping some or all of the work items into work projects. This process is described in the topic <a href="work_projects/wm_creating_and_editing_a_project.htm" class="MCXref xref">Organize Work Items into a Project</a>. (Alternatively, for more detail, you can start at <a href="work_projects/about_work_project.htm" class="MCXref xref">About Work Projects</a>).</li>
            <li>Entering or editing anticipated funding levels by year, at <span class="span_1">Work Configuration</span> &gt; <span class="span_1">Funding</span> &gt; <span class="span_1">Expected Funds</span> tab; see the topic "Add a Funding Stream" in <MadCapconditionalText data-mc-conditions="Primary.ScreenOnly"><a href="6_funding/wm-add-funding-stream.htm" class="MCXref xref">Add a Funding Stream</a>.</MadCapconditionalText></li>
        </ul>
        <p>Regardless of the type of work planned, a work item record is generated for each work activity needed. </p>
        <p>The work item stores basic information about what work is planned, including the type of work, description, estimated cost, funding year, and quantity. Groups of work items can be viewed in several useful ways, such as:</p>
        <ul>
            <li> a list of all past, present, and future work in the Building </li>
            <li>a list filtered by year, status, System, Component, and/or Component-Section </li>
        </ul>
