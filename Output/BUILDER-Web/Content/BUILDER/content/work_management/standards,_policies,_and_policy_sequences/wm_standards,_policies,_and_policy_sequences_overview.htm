        <h1><a name="kanchor261"></a>Work Configuration Overview</h1>
        <p>With your Building inventory, condition assessment, and functionality data in place, you can begin to truly manage the work in your facility/Building using BUILDER's powerful tools. Condition assessment data is used to plan maintenance and repair work at the Component-Section level, and functionality assessment data is used to plan modernization work at the Building and Functional Area level. </p>
        <h2>Work Configuration is a Prerequisite for Creating Work Plans</h2>
        <p>Before the assessment data can be used in an automated process to determine work requirements for your inventory, the following must be created:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Condition standards</li>
            <li>Condition policies</li>
            <li>One or more condition policy sequences</li>
            <li>Functionality standards (if functionality assessments are performed)</li>
            <li>Functionality policies (if functionality assessments are performed)</li>
            <li>One or more functionality policy sequences (if functionality assessments are performed)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The tools listed above will determine the work requirements. However, because funding amounts may be less than the total of work requirements, you will also want the following: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>One or more prioritization schemes</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Using Condition Standards, Policies, and Policy Sequences</h2>

        <p>Intuitively, when the <a href="javascript:void(0)" class="MCTextPopup MCTextPopupHotSpot MCTextPopup_Open MCTextPopupHotSpot_ MCTextPopupHotSpot_Popup #text #textPopup">CI<img class="MCHelpControl_Image_Icon" src="../../../Skins/Default/Stylesheets/Images/transparent_16x11.gif" alt="Closed" data-mc-alt2="Open" style="width: 16;height: 11;" /><span class="MCTextPopupBody popupBody"><span class="MCTextPopupArrow"> </span>Condition Index</span></a> value is high, no work action needs to be taken.

This threshold value might be the same for all Component-Sections, or it might vary depending upon how critical a particular Section is to the overall Building. For example, a <a href="javascript:void(0)" class="MCTextPopup MCTextPopupHotSpot MCTextPopup_Open MCTextPopupHotSpot_ MCTextPopupHotSpot_Popup #text #textPopup">CI<img class="MCHelpControl_Image_Icon" src="../../../Skins/Default/Stylesheets/Images/transparent_16x11.gif" alt="Closed" data-mc-alt2="Open" style="width: 16;height: 11;" /><span class="MCTextPopupBody popupBody"><span class="MCTextPopupArrow"> </span>Condition Index</span></a> of 80 might be the threshold for an air handling unit, while a <a href="javascript:void(0)" class="MCTextPopup MCTextPopupHotSpot MCTextPopup_Open MCTextPopupHotSpot_ MCTextPopupHotSpot_Popup #text #textPopup">CI<img class="MCHelpControl_Image_Icon" src="../../../Skins/Default/Stylesheets/Images/transparent_16x11.gif" alt="Closed" data-mc-alt2="Open" style="width: 16;height: 11;" /><span class="MCTextPopupBody popupBody"><span class="MCTextPopupArrow"> </span>Condition Index</span></a> of 65 might be the threshold for an interior door.</p>
        <p>Additionally, these thresholds may vary from Building to Building. A headquarters Building might have a threshold <a href="javascript:void(0)" class="MCTextPopup MCTextPopupHotSpot MCTextPopup_Open MCTextPopupHotSpot_ MCTextPopupHotSpot_Popup #text #textPopup">CI<img class="MCHelpControl_Image_Icon" src="../../../Skins/Default/Stylesheets/Images/transparent_16x11.gif" alt="Closed" data-mc-alt2="Open" style="width: 16;height: 11;" /><span class="MCTextPopupBody popupBody"><span class="MCTextPopupArrow"> </span>Condition Index</span></a> of 85 for interior doors, while a warehouse might have a threshold <a href="javascript:void(0)" class="MCTextPopup MCTextPopupHotSpot MCTextPopup_Open MCTextPopupHotSpot_ MCTextPopupHotSpot_Popup #text #textPopup">CI<img class="MCHelpControl_Image_Icon" src="../../../Skins/Default/Stylesheets/Images/transparent_16x11.gif" alt="Closed" data-mc-alt2="Open" style="width: 16;height: 11;" /><span class="MCTextPopupBody popupBody"><span class="MCTextPopupArrow"> </span>Condition Index</span></a> of 65 for interior doors. Similarly, there is a threshold value for determining whether to repair or replace a Section. This threshold value is a ratio of the repair cost to the replacement cost (in BUILDER it is assumed that the cost of repair is variable, increasing as the <a href="javascript:void(0)" class="MCTextPopup MCTextPopupHotSpot MCTextPopup_Open MCTextPopupHotSpot_ MCTextPopupHotSpot_Popup #text #textPopup">CI<img class="MCHelpControl_Image_Icon" src="../../../Skins/Default/Stylesheets/Images/transparent_16x11.gif" alt="Closed" data-mc-alt2="Open" style="width: 16;height: 11;" /><span class="MCTextPopupBody popupBody"><span class="MCTextPopupArrow"> </span>Condition Index</span></a> decreases). When the ratio is below the threshold the Section will be repaired, and when the ratio is above the threshold the Section will be replaced.</p>
        <p>When you establish a set of threshold values like those described above, an automated process can use these thresholds to search the entire inventory and identify Sections whose metrics indicate where work should be initiated. With this BUILDER-generated list, you can anticipate the location of condition deficiencies and plan to correct them before failure occurs. </p>
        <p>If condition assessments are completed regularly, the <a href="javascript:void(0)" class="MCTextPopup MCTextPopupHotSpot MCTextPopup_Open MCTextPopupHotSpot_ MCTextPopupHotSpot_Popup #text #textPopup">CI<img class="MCHelpControl_Image_Icon" src="../../../Skins/Default/Stylesheets/Images/transparent_16x11.gif" alt="Closed" data-mc-alt2="Open" style="width: 16;height: 11;" /><span class="MCTextPopupBody popupBody"><span class="MCTextPopupArrow"> </span>Condition Index</span></a> trend analysis can estimate when the threshold <a href="javascript:void(0)" class="MCTextPopup MCTextPopupHotSpot MCTextPopup_Open MCTextPopupHotSpot_ MCTextPopupHotSpot_Popup #text #textPopup">CI<img class="MCHelpControl_Image_Icon" src="../../../Skins/Default/Stylesheets/Images/transparent_16x11.gif" alt="Closed" data-mc-alt2="Open" style="width: 16;height: 11;" /><span class="MCTextPopupBody popupBody"><span class="MCTextPopupArrow"> </span>Condition Index</span></a> will be reached, several years before it actually happens. This is valuable information for preparing out-year budgets. In addition, because the search of your inventory is exhaustive, no potential problems "fall through the cracks." All of this supports a very proactive management strategy.</p>
        <p>The concepts presented in the preceding paragraphs can be implemented using <span class="mc-variable Primary.Product variable">BUILDER</span>'s <a href="../1_standards/wm_about_standards.htm">standards</a>, <a href="../2_policies/wm_about_policies.htm">policies</a>, and <a href="../3_policy-sequences/wm_about_policy_sequences.htm">policy sequences</a>. </p>
        <h4>Condition Standards</h4>
        <p>Condition standards are sets of threshold values that determine whether or not work is needed when applied to a particular Component-Section. </p>
        <h4>Condition Policies</h4>
        <p>Condition policies are rules that define, by property, which Component-Sections will use which condition standards. </p>
        <h4>Condition Policy Sequences</h4>
        <p>When a single Component-Section is covered by more than one condition policy, a policy sequence establishes the order of precedence for applying policies so that only one condition standard is selected for each Component-Section.</p>
        <h3>Example</h3>
        <p>Here is a simple example of how condition standards, condition policies, and policy sequences are used to assign thresholds to every Component-Section:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Suppose that you have decided that your inventory contains certain Sections that you want to maintain at a <a href="javascript:void(0)" class="MCTextPopup MCTextPopupHotSpot MCTextPopup_Open MCTextPopupHotSpot_ MCTextPopupHotSpot_Popup #text #textPopup">CI<img class="MCHelpControl_Image_Icon" src="../../../Skins/Default/Stylesheets/Images/transparent_16x11.gif" alt="Closed" data-mc-alt2="Open" style="width: 16;height: 11;" /><span class="MCTextPopupBody popupBody"><span class="MCTextPopupArrow"> </span>Condition Index</span></a> of 80 or above, or that repair is required when the <a href="javascript:void(0)" class="MCTextPopup MCTextPopupHotSpot MCTextPopup_Open MCTextPopupHotSpot_ MCTextPopupHotSpot_Popup #text #textPopup">CI<img class="MCHelpControl_Image_Icon" src="../../../Skins/Default/Stylesheets/Images/transparent_16x11.gif" alt="Closed" data-mc-alt2="Open" style="width: 16;height: 11;" /><span class="MCTextPopupBody popupBody"><span class="MCTextPopupArrow"> </span>Condition Index</span></a> falls below 80. Also, you have decided that if the cost of repairing such a Section is more than 70% of its replacement cost, then you will replace it rather than repair it. These decisions are represented in a condition standard - a set of threshold values. You <a href="../1_standards/wm_add_condition_standard.htm">create that condition standard</a> and call it "High." Your inventory also contains some Sections for which 60 is to be the threshold <a href="javascript:void(0)" class="MCTextPopup MCTextPopupHotSpot MCTextPopup_Open MCTextPopupHotSpot_ MCTextPopupHotSpot_Popup #text #textPopup">CI<img class="MCHelpControl_Image_Icon" src="../../../Skins/Default/Stylesheets/Images/transparent_16x11.gif" alt="Closed" data-mc-alt2="Open" style="width: 16;height: 11;" /><span class="MCTextPopupBody popupBody"><span class="MCTextPopupArrow"> </span>Condition Index</span></a>. You create that condition standard and call it "Low." </li>
            <li>To apply these condition standards, you must <a href="../2_policies/wm_add_condition_policy.htm#Adding_Condition_Policies">create condition policies</a> that link them to specific Component-Sections. You may want administrative Buildings to be maintained under the "High" condition standard and warehouses to be maintained under the "Low" condition standard. You would create a condition policy that links the respective standard with the appropriate Buildings. You might also want all of the Sections of an HVAC System in any Building to be maintained under the "High" condition standard. You would create another condition policy that links the "High" condition standard with HVAC systems. Note that a policy may not specify standards for every category, such as in the example of the HVAC condition policy which does nothing to determine condition standards for the other Systems in a Building.</li>
            <li>If you want to apply only these two condition policies, several problems arise. You must <a href="../3_policy-sequences/wm_add_policy_sequence.htm">create a policy sequence</a> to take care of these problems. First, the two policies mention nothing about the condition standards for training facilities other than the HVAC system. The overall process must be able to determine a condition standard for every Component-Section. To address this problem, a policy sequence has a default condition standard that is used if none of the selected condition policies apply. The default condition standard is one of the standards you have created, and you designate it as the default. </li>
            <li>Second, both condition policies apply to HVAC systems in warehouses. The first sets the condition standard at "Low" and the second sets it at "High." The overall process must be able to select one and only one condition standard for each Component-Section. To address this problem, the policy sequence lists, in the order of their application, all of the condition policies that are to be used. If the HVAC policy is listed after the warehouse policy, then the HVAC policy prevails and the condition standard will be "High." If the warehouse policy is listed after the HVAC policy, then the warehouse policy prevails and the condition standard will be "Low." That is, the last policy in the list governs the applicable Component-Sections.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>When you establish a set of threshold values like those described above, an automated process can use these thresholds to search the entire inventory and identify Buildings and Functional Areas whose metrics indicate where modernization or entire Building reconstruction should be initiated. With this BUILDER-generated list, you can pinpoint the location of functionality and performance deficiencies and plan to correct them. In addition, because the search of your inventory is exhaustive, no potential problems "fall through the cracks." All of this supports a very proactive management strategy.</p>
        <p>The concepts presented in the preceding paragraphs can be implemented using <span class="mc-variable Primary.Product variable">BUILDER</span>'s <a href="../1_standards/wm_about_standards.htm">standards</a>, <a href="../2_policies/wm_about_policies.htm">policies</a>, and <a href="../3_policy-sequences/wm_about_policy_sequences.htm">policy sequences</a>. </p>
        <h4>Functionality Standards</h4>
        <p> Functionality standards are sets of threshold values that determine whether or not work is needed when applied to a particular Building and/or Functional Area. </p>
        <h4>Functionality Policies</h4>
        <p>Functionality policies are rules that define, by property, which Buildings and Functional Areas will use which functionality standards. </p>
        <h4>Functionality Policy Sequences</h4>
        <p>When a single Building or Functional Area is covered by more than one functionality policy, a policy sequence establishes the order of precedence for applying policies so that only one functionality standard is chosen for each Building.</p>
        <h3>Example</h3>
        <p>Here is a simple example of how functionality standards, functionality policies, and policy sequences are used to assign thresholds to every Building:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Suppose that you have decided that your inventory contains certain Buildings (with Functional Areas) that you want to maintain at a <a href="javascript:void(0)" class="MCTextPopup MCTextPopupHotSpot MCTextPopup_Open MCTextPopupHotSpot_ #text">BFI<img class="MCHelpControl_Image_Icon" src="../../../Skins/Default/Stylesheets/Images/transparent_16x11.gif" alt="Closed" data-mc-alt2="Open" style="width: 16;height: 11;" /><span class="MCTextPopupBody popupBody"><span class="MCTextPopupArrow"> </span>Building Functionality Index - computed from the results of a functionality assessment.</span></a>, <a href="javascript:void(0)" class="MCTextPopup MCTextPopupHotSpot MCTextPopup_Open MCTextPopupHotSpot_ MCTextPopupHotSpot_Popup #text #textPopup">FAFI<img class="MCHelpControl_Image_Icon" src="../../../Skins/Default/Stylesheets/Images/transparent_16x11.gif" alt="Closed" data-mc-alt2="Open" style="width: 16;height: 11;" /><span class="MCTextPopupBody popupBody"><span class="MCTextPopupArrow"> </span>Functional Area Functionality Index</span></a>, and issue FIs of 80 or above, or that modernization is required when any of the FIs fall below 80. Also, you have decided that if the <a href="javascript:void(0)" class="MCTextPopup MCTextPopupHotSpot MCTextPopup_Open MCTextPopupHotSpot_ #text">BPI<img class="MCHelpControl_Image_Icon" src="../../../Skins/Default/Stylesheets/Images/transparent_16x11.gif" alt="Closed" data-mc-alt2="Open" style="width: 16;height: 11;" /><span class="MCTextPopupBody popupBody"><span class="MCTextPopupArrow"> </span>Building Performance Index - a measure of a Building's overall performance, derived from a weighted combination of the BCI and BFI, where the lower of the two values is given two-thirds of the weight and the higher of the two values is given one-third of the weight. If no functional assessment has been performed, the BFI is assigned a value of 100.</span></a> falls below 70, then reconstruction of the facility/Building will be required. These decisions are represented in a functionality standard - a set of threshold values. You <a href="../1_standards/wm_add_functionality_standard.htm">create that functionality standard</a> and call it "High." Your inventory also contains some Buildings for which 60 is to be the threshold for all the FIs and the <a href="javascript:void(0)" class="MCTextPopup MCTextPopupHotSpot MCTextPopup_Open MCTextPopupHotSpot_ #text">BPI<img class="MCHelpControl_Image_Icon" src="../../../Skins/Default/Stylesheets/Images/transparent_16x11.gif" alt="Closed" data-mc-alt2="Open" style="width: 16;height: 11;" /><span class="MCTextPopupBody popupBody"><span class="MCTextPopupArrow"> </span>Building Performance Index - a measure of a Building's overall performance, derived from a weighted combination of the BCI and BFI, where the lower of the two values is given two-thirds of the weight and the higher of the two values is given one-third of the weight. If no functional assessment has been performed, the BFI is assigned a value of 100.</span></a>. You create that functionality standard and call it "Low." </li>
            <li>To apply these functionality standards, you must <a href="../2_policies/wm_add_functionality_policy.htm#Adding%20Functionality%20Policies">create functionality policies</a> that link them to specific Buildings and/or Functional Areas. You might, for example, want administrative Buildings (and all Functional Areas in those Buildings) to be maintained under the "High" functionality standard, and housing Buildings (and all Functional Areas in those Buildings) to be maintained under the "Low" functionality standard. You would create a functionality policy that links the respective standard with the appropriate Buildings. You might also want all the display Functional Areas (in all Buildings) to be maintained under the "High" functionality standard. You would create another functionality policy that links the "High" functionality standard with display Functional Areas. Note that a policy may not specify standards for every category, such as in the example of the display area policy which does nothing to determine functionality standards for the Functional Areas other than display areas in all Buildings.</li>
            <li>If you want to apply only these two functionality policies, several problems arise. You must <a href="../3_policy-sequences/wm_add_policy_sequence.htm">create a policy sequence</a> to take care of the problems. First, the two policies mention nothing about the functionality standards for non-display Functional Areas in Buildings that are not administration or housing. The overall process must be able to determine a functionality standard for every Functional Area in every Building. To address this problem, a policy sequence has a default functionality standard that is used if none of the selected functionality policies apply. The default functionality standard is one of the standards you have created, and you designate it as the default. </li>
            <li>Second, both functionality policies apply to display areas in administration and housing Buildings. The first sets the functionality standard at "Low" and the second sets it at "High" for housing Buildings. The overall process must be able to select one and only one functionality standard for each Building. To address this problem, the policy sequence lists, in the order of their application, all of the functionality policies that are to be used. If the housing policy is listed after the display area policy, then the housing policy prevails and the functionality standard will be "Low." If the display area policy is listed after the housing policy, then the display area policy prevails and the functionality standard will be "High." That is, the last policy in the list governs the applicable Functional Areas and/or Buildings.</li>
        </ul>
