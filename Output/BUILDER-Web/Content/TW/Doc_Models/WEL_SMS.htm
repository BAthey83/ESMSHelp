        <!-- (AF) Following is an example of how to write the popup link. The thing is, this is the very FIRST page to come up when the user opens BUILDER, so I'm not sure where to put this code: it would be one level up, and I am not succeeding in getting Properties to open for the (Flare) Content folder. And of course there would be no actual link that the user is clicking on with the text "Click here...". The specification would need to be at the computer level.  Anyhow, this is the example link:

    (Boutell)	When it comes time to actually open such a window, just write a link like the following:

		<a href="page.html" target="popup"
		onClick="wopen('page.html', 'popup', 640, 480); return false;"> Click here to open the page in a new window. </a>

                        <p>The Sustainment Management System (SMS)  Version <span class="mc-variable Primary.SystemIncVersion variable">September 2018 Draft"</span> is the newest version under development by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers at its Engineering Research and Development Center–Construction Engineering Research Laboratory (ERDC-CERL) in Champaign, IL. </p>
                        <p class="center"><a name="kanchor1364"></a>Depending on a user's needs and licensing, the SMS framework provides Web-based access to the latest versions of  BUILDER™ and/or ROOFER™, automated tools that support engineering and facility management decisions regarding when, where, and how best to maintain buildings and their key components. </p>
                        <p class="noBlankLines">While the Sustainment Management System has been developed for military installations, it is applicable for any organization with facility management responsibilities. License agreements providing access to the SMS technology are available from multiple providers. </p>
                        <h2>BUILDER™</h2>
                        <p>
                            BUILDER provides facility managers with the tools they need to generate the greatest impact from maintenance and rehabilitation activities, and to plan and defend maintenance budgets.</p>
                        <p>The primary measure used in BUILDER is the <span class="span_9">condition index</span> (CI) rating, using a 0&#8209;to&#8209;100 point scale. After real property inventory has been subdivided into hierarchical levels of increasing fineness, down to the Component-Section level, the condition index for each Component-Section is computed from inspection data that records the type, severity, and density of each distress found.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hr width="100%" size="0" align="center" />
                        </p>
                        <p><span class="span_9">Deterioration curves, developed from experience over time, show the optimal point at which work should be done to avoid more costly rehabilitation projects later.</span>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <hr width="100%" size="0" align="center" />
                        </p>
                        <p>Another measure available in BUILDER is the <span class="span_9">functionality index</span> (FI), also on a 0&#8209;to&#8209;100 point scale  in keeping with the SMS design philosophy. It is computed from assessment data that records the functionality issues present in a building. Based on the severity and density of those issues, building modernization requirements can be identified.</p>
                        <p> Based on condition index and/or functionality index scores, BUILDER can generate recommended work items automatically. Using cost books associated with BUILDER, cost estimates are attached to the work items. Managers can then choose which work items to fund. The cost of <span class="span_9">not</span> funding work items can be determined using Scenarios.</p>
                        <p>With the assistance of the Scenarios simulation engine included as part of BUILDER, managers can develop long-range work plans based on a sound investment strategy. By providing an objective description of condition (a core BUILDER functionality)&#160;and an automated means of exploring various options under different budget scenarios (Scenarios), BUILDER and Scenarios together make multi-year work plans easier to formulate and funding requests easier to justify. The goal is optimal facility performance for the dollars invested.</p>

                        <h2>ROOFER</h2>
                        <p>ROOFER uses standardized inspection procedures and numerical indexes for assessing condition. A roof's condition is determined based on distress data collected during visual inspections; for insulated membrane roofs, additional information is provided by nondestructive moisture surveys and gravimetric analysis of core cuts.</p>
                        <p>The inspection data provide the information needed to generate condition indices for the major roof components and an overall roof condition index (RCI). Component indexes for the membrane (MCI), flashing (FCI) and insulation (ICI) comprise the RCI for low-slope membrane roofs. For asphalt shingle roofs, two component indexes, the shingle condition index and the FCI, comprise the RCI. These indexes provide an objective, consistent measure of roof condition, repairs needed, and waterproof integrity.</p>
                        <p>ROOFER enables building managers to rate their present roof condition, prioritize projects, and optimally allocate the budget. At the project level, ROOFER can help select repair and replacement strategies and identify work requirements. In the long term, this technology results in maximized roof conditions using available funds.</p>
