        <hr width="100%" size="0" align="center" />
        <p>This topic introduces tasks you can initiate at the Assessments screen and provides links to greater detail. To reach the Assessments screen, activate the <img src="../../Imgs-Web/Dashboard/no-text-wkplan_20x20.png" class="icon" alt="" style="width: 20;height: 20;" />&#160;<span class="span_1">Assessments</span> tile on the ESMS Dashboard. </p>
        <hr width="100%" size="0" align="center" />
        <h2>What Can I Do Here?</h2>
        <p>At the Assessments screen, you can open an existing assessment listed in the table (see <a href="View-Wkflow-Wkplan.htm" class="MCXref xref">View Assessment</a> or <a href="Edit-Wkflow-Wkplan.htm" class="MCXref xref">Edit Assessment</a>), or (with appropriate permissions) create a new assessment (see <a href="Add-Wkflow-Wkplan.htm" class="MCXref xref">Add Assessment</a>). </p>
        <p class="indent"><span class="span_1">Note:</span> Only assessments you have permission to view and/or work with will appear in the table.</p>
        <p>In ESMS, you can create an assessment either with or without using the ESMS Workflow Engine tool ("Workflow"). Workflow is a tool that applies a custom-designed scheme of specific steps and approvals to your assessment process. Each type of assessment is described below, at <a href="#About2" class="MCXref xref">About Creating an Assessment Without Workflow</a> and at <a href="#About" class="MCXref xref">About Creating an Assessment Using Workflow</a>.</p>
        <h2>Permissions Needed for Assessments/Workflow</h2>
        <ul>
            <li value="1">To edit or view information in stages of an assessment after it has been created, you need the ESMS permission named "Assessment Editor.". This can be set up either (a) as a scoped permission / role (restricted to a particular site), or (b) as a global permission, to edit or view any assessment.</li>
            <li value="2">To create an assessment, one either with or without workflow, you need "AssessmentRole" permission. This permission allows you to activate the <span class="span_1">Save</span> button in the "Create Assessment" popup. It can be set up either (a) as a scoped permission / role (restricted to a particular site), or (b) as a global permission.</li>
            <li value="3">To see the <span class="span_1">Workflow Editor</span> tile on the Dashboard and to edit or create schemes that govern the workflow through an assessment, you need "WorkflowRole" permission. The "WorkflowRole" permission is global only.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>These permissions are granted by an ESMS administrator at the Security tile, <span class="span_1">Users</span> tab, <span class="span_1">Global Permissions</span> and/or <span class="span_1">User Workspace</span> section. </p>
        <!--
            <ol>
                <li>At the <span class="span_1">Assessments</span> tile, you specify assets, team members, etc. for each stage in the assessment design process. The transitions between the stages will be governed by the scheme selected for the assessment. If an appropriate scheme is available for selection, you should be able to perform all of your assessment tasks at the <span class="span_1">Assessments</span> tile.</li>
                <li>At the <span class="span_1">Workflow Editor</span> tile, you can create diagrams to construct additional schemes. If you need to alter an existing scheme or to create a new one, you will also need to perform tasks at the <span class="span_1">Workflow Editor</span> tile. </li>
            </ol>
    -->
        <h2><a name="About2"></a>About Creating a Assessment Without Workflow</h2>
        <p>If you create a new assessment without enabling Workflow, the assessment will have two stages: Charter and Assessment.</p>
        <h3><a name="Work"></a>Assessment Setup (No Workflow)</h3>
        <p>Before proceeding to the stages of the assessment, there is information to be defined when you create the assessment:</p>
        <ul>
            <li value="1">Name the sssessment</li>
            <li value="2">Specify the site the assessment will be associated with</li>
            <li value="3">Select a domain</li>
            <li value="4">Set a budget (this can be changed at the <span class="Primaryone">Charter</span> stage) </li>
            <li value="5">Draw up a charter for the <span class="Primaryzero">Assessment entry</span> (this can be edited at the <span class="Primaryone">Charter</span> stage) </li>
            <li value="6">Set a planned assessment date (this can be changed at the <span class="Primaryone">Charter</span> stage) </li>
            <li value="7">Assign users to PM, engineering, and/or reviewer roles</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Charter Stage (No Workflow)</h3>
        <p>When Workflow has not been enabled at the "Create Assessment" popup, the Charter stage screen will display just one tab: <span class="span_1">Details</span>. Here you can view and (sometimes) change details that were specified during <a href="#Work">assessment setup</a>. Site and domain can <span class="emph">not</span> be changed. </p>
        <h3>Assessment Stage (No Workflow)</h3>
        <p>When you navigate to the Assessment stage using the <span class="span_1">Draft DSR</span> button in the Workflow navigation, </p>
        <p class="p_26">
            <img src="about-imgs/nav-noscheme-flyout-asmt-in-red-box_250x200.png" alt="" style="width: 250;height: 200;" />
        </p>
        <p>you will be brought to a Work Items page where you can manually add, edit, and delete work items.</p>
        <h2><a name="About"></a>About Creating a Assessment Using Workflow</h2>
        <p> This section, plus <a href="#five-stages" class="MCXref xref">Description of the Workflow Process</a>, describe creating an assessment using the Workflow feature provided by the ESMS Workflow Engine tool.</p>
        <p>If Workflow is enabled during assessment creation (this is done by marking the <span class="span_1">Enabled</span> checkbox at the <span class="span_1">Workflow</span> entry), then a work <span class="new-term">scheme</span> must also be selected during assessment creation. The scheme will guide progress through the assessment, from resource planning to importing work items created in the field to including those work items into work packages. </p>
        <p>If an appropriate scheme is not available for selection, there are two alternatives:</p>
        <ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha;">
            <li value="1"><span class="span_1">Edit an existing scheme.</span> If an existing scheme can be tweaked to suit, this can be done  at the <span class="span_1">Workflow Editor</span> tile.
                <p class="indent"><span class="span_1">IMPORTANT:</span> If you need to alter an existing scheme, make sure to do so <span class="emph">before</span> selecting the scheme for your ssessment. When a scheme is selected for a assessment, that assessment operates from a snapshot made of the scheme at that point in time. This protects users from surprise changes to a scheme they are using.</p></li>
            <li value="2"><span class="span_1">Add a new scheme.</span> Alternatively, a brand new scheme can be added at the <span class="span_1">Workflow Editor</span> tile. Using the Workflow editor, you can design the sequential stages of creating an assessment using selected parameters.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>Begin at the topic <a href="../../ESMS-WkflowEditor/ESMS-CreateScheme-About.htm" class="MCXref xref"> Understanding the Workflow Editor </a> for  information about editing or creating a scheme.</p>
        <h2><a name="five-stages"></a><a name="kanchor62"></a>Description of the Workflow Process</h2>
        <p>A workflow process is defined by (1) activities and (2) transitions that link the activities together. The activities for creating an assessment are grouped into <span class="PrimarynumberOfStages">six</span> stages, described in <a href="#Stages" class="MCXref xref">Stages</a>. The flow is governed by a <a href="#Scheme">scheme</a>.</p>
        <p>Stages are defined at the <span class="span_1">Assessments</span> tile on the ESMS Dashboard, and are listed farther below in this topic. The work flow scheme is defined at the <span class="span_1">Workflow Editor</span> tile on the ESMS Dashboard.</p>
        <h3>Assessment Setup (Using Workflow)</h3>
        <p>Before designing the stages of the assessment, there is information to be defined when you create the assessment:</p>
        <ul>
            <li value="1">Name the assessment</li>
            <li value="2">Specify the site the assessment will be associated with</li>
            <li value="3">Select a domain </li>
            <li value="4">Set a budget (this can be changed at the <span class="Primaryone">Charter</span> stage)</li>
            <li value="5">Draw up a charter for the <span class="Primaryzero">assessment entry</span> (this can be edited at the <span class="Primaryone">Charter</span> stage)</li>
            <li value="6">Set a planned assessment date (this can be changed at the <span class="Primaryone">Charter</span> stage)</li>
            <li value="7">Select a workflow scheme</li>
            <li value="8">Select a template for the pre-assessment questionnaire</li>
            <li value="9">Select a template for the assessment questionnaire</li>
            <li value="10">Assign users to PM, engineering, and/or reviewer roles</li>

        <h2><a name="Using"></a>About Using the Workflow Process </h2>
        <p>Once the workflow process and the stages have been established, the information at each stage's tabs can guide team members in their roles and responsibilities. For example, the <span class="span_1">Pre-Assessment Team</span> tab at the Charter stage shows who is responsible for filling out the pre-assessment questionnaire in the Pre-Assessment stage.  </p>
        <p>
            <!-- this section is cited in "Scheme" section above -->At each stage of the workflow process, the <span class="span_1">Workflow</span> section at the bottom of the screen will vary in appearance depending on the scheme and other factors. If there are actions to be taken to proceed (or revert) to another stage in the workflow, this will be indicated by one or more buttons in the <span class="span_1">Workflow</span> section. For example:
        </p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p class="p_26">
            <img src="about-imgs/smp1-bottom-wkflow-approve-btn_600x325.png" alt="" style="width: 600;height: 325;" />
        </p>
        <p>When a user with appropriate permissions approves the transition and confirms it in the popup that appears when the <span class="span_1">Approve to Pre-Assessment</span> button is activated (see screenshot below for image of the confirmation popup), then the workflow progresses to that stage.</p>
        <p class="p_26">
            <img src="about-imgs/smp2-confirm-pop.png" alt="" />
        </p>
        <h2>About Tracking Workflow Status</h2>
        <p>In an assessment stage, the name of the current state is displayed near the top of the page (for example  "Project Planning" in the screen shown at <a href="#Using" class="MCXref xref">About Using the Workflow Process </a>). <span class="new-term">State</span> is a term used in the Workflow editor to refer to an element in the <a href="#Scheme">scheme</a>. </p>
        <p>You can activate either the state name, or the clock icon next to it, to see the "Transition History" popup listing all actions that&#160;have been taken to move the workflow along, such as approvals, comments, or transitions to another state/stage (see sample below in the screenshot). You might also receive alerts of these actions on the main menu bar (the bell icon will have a red circle on it showing the number of alerts), if the <span class="span_1">Notifications enabled</span> checkbox was marked in the <span class="span_1">Required Permission</span> section of the "Transition" popup when the scheme transition was designed or edited in the <a href="../../ESMS-WkflowEditor/ESMS-CreateScheme-About.htm">Workflow Editor</a>. </p>
        <p class="p_26">

        <h2>Assessment Level Tasks</h2>
        <p>The following assessment tasks can be initiated at the Assessments screen:</p>

        <h2>Stage Level Tasks</h2>
        <p>Other changes to an assessment can be made at the appropriate stage within the assessment. The stages of a workflow-enabled assessment are determined by the scheme being used. Currently, the workflow provided with ESMS consists of the following stages, which are described at <a href="#Stages" class="MCXref xref">Stages</a>:</p>
        <ul>
