        <h1>Appendix A: <MadCap:keyword term="Get Username and Password:Enterprise SMS" />Differences Between Enterprise SMS and SMS Inventory</h1>
        <hr />
        <p>This topic is designed to help users of any of the legacy SMS modules (BUILDER, PAVER, RAILER, FUELER, etc.) understand the differences between legacy SMS inventory structure and Enterprise SMS inventory structure.</p>
        <hr />
        <p>
            <MadCap:keyword term="Component:view" />This topic is created to help with the transition from using legacy SMS to using Enterprise SMS.
Enterprise SMS unifies data in the individual legacy SMS databases into a common data framework that encompasses all asset domains.  That means, for example, that someone can view information for their buildings alongside information for the utility infrastructure that serves those buildings.
 </p>
        <p>In aligning the data schema for each individual asset domain into this common data framework, some minor refactoring of the asset inventory structure was done.  </p>
        <h2>Tree Structure vs. Logical Structure</h2>
        <p>
            <MadCap:keyword term="Add:component" />In the legacy SMS data schema, is was common to think of the inventory structure as a tree.  At the top level is a facility, which typically aligns one-for-one with an organizationally defined real property record.  A physical example of a facility might be a building, an electrical substation, or the electrical distribution that serves the site.  In the middle level of the tree, the facility is typically decomposed into systems (such as foundations, roofing, or HVAC, as in the case for buildings), or geographic zones (such as branches, sections, and segments as in the case for linear type assets).  At the lowest level of the tree, the systems or zones are broken out into the individual components that comprise a functioning facility.  Thus, the component represents the lowest or fundamental level of management in the SMS.
</p>
        <p> In Enterprise SMS, the facility still represents the top level of the physical inventory within a site, and components represent the lowest level of the physical inventory.  However, the rigid hierarchical "tree" structure has been replaced with logical associations. Specifications are the logical analogy in Enterprise SMS&#160;that correspond to a  <MadCap:glossaryTerm glossTerm="Primary.Term24">CMC</MadCap:glossaryTerm> in BUILDER. From an engineering standpoint, a component is always associated with a system. Work plans, on the other hand, are generated at the level of the facility that is directly associated with the component. </p>
        <p>Additionally, to provide more flexibility in organizing assets to be managed, the concept of a <span class="new-term" style="font-weight: bold;">group</span> has been introduced. </p>
        <h2>
            <MadCap:keyword term="Search:Groups" />Groups</h2>
        <p>Defined simply, a group is a collection of managed objects that may exist within a facility, or across multiple facilities. Technically, it consists of one or more components.</p>
        <!-- as of October 2018, only components within a group, no nested groups; so wait to include the following: "and/or one or more other groups."-->
        <p>Some options as to what a group can represent are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>a functional system, such as all of the components associated to the roofing system of a building</li>
            <li>a zone, such as all the components located on the building’s first floor</li>
            <li>all assets managed by a particular outside party or belonging to a specific joint venture.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The functionality attached to a group also provides greater flexibility, a departure from the rigid tree structure of legacy SMS. In contrast to a tree, where a component can appear in only one location, logical associations allow a component to exist in multiple groups.  For example, an air handling unit can belong to the HVAC system, and can at the same time belong to the first floor zone. </p>
        <p>
            <!-- Groups can also be composed of sub-groups.  This allows components to be associated into local network segments, which can in turn be grouped into larger network branches.  -->
		Finally, groups can span multiple facilities if you are trying to model a function that is supported by components that may exist in more than one facility. </p>
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>In conclusion, the revised inventory structure  of Enterprise SMS allows freedom from the rigid tree structure of legacy SMS, while retaining the concepts of facility and component as constants. </p>
        <p>The new concept of groups allows inventory data to be organized and accessed in a greater variety of ways, because </p>
        <ul>
            <li>a component can belong to more than one group</li>
            <!-- HOLD for capability of group within a group:
            <li>both components and other groups are permissible members of groups, allowing a great deal of flexibility as to group composition</li>
            <li>groups can be nested</li>
-->
            <li> a group can contain components from multiple facilities </li>
        </ul>
