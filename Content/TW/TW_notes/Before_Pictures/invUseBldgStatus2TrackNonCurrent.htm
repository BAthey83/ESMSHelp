        <h1>Using Current Status to Track Non-Current Buildings</h1>
        <p><a name="kanchor434"></a>The Current Status property allows you to have records in your BUILDER™ database for Buildings that are not currently in your physical inventory. This is useful for Buildings at both ends of the life-cycle. You may keep records for Buildings that have been demolished or transferred, and you may add Buildings planned for future construction or acquisition. </p>
        <h3>Adding Buildings To Be Built or Acquired in the Future </h3>
        <p>Using the Current Status property, it is possible to enter Buildings into the database before they are actually in the physical inventory. This includes Buildings under construction (designated with status "To be built") and existing Buildings being considered for acquisition from another owner (designated with status "To be acquired"). With the Current Status property, you will be able to assess short-term work requirements for newly acquired existing Buildings and to plan long-term maintenance requirements for future Buildings using Scenarios. </p>
        <p>If you enter records for a Building with status "To be acquired", you may record inspection results prior to acquisition. The BUILDER processes that determine remaining service life and condition prediction will track the condition of the Building after it is first entered and prior to acquisition. With this information, BUILDER will be able to generate a work plan for the Building to upgrade it to the standards established by an appropriate policy sequence. Such information could be invaluable in planning for the load such a Building will place on both short and long term budgets.</p>
        <p>If you enter a Building with status "To be built", you may not record new inspections until the status changes to "Active". The BUILDER processes that determine remaining service life and condition prediction will skip such a Building, under the assumption that quality assurance during the construction process will force all Systems to a CI of 100 prior to commissioning. The advantage of entering the Building before it is built is that you may include it in  Scenarios to measure its long-term effects on work plans and budgets That is, the Scenario can change the status of a new Building to "Active" at a scheduled time and begin treating it as a normal Building with predictable deterioration rates and work requirements. </p>
        <h3>Keeping Records for Buildings That Have Been Demolished or Transferred </h3>
        <p><a name="kanchor435"></a>In earlier versions of the BUILDER application, the only way to eliminate a Building from the automated assessment and planning processes used by BUILDER and Scenarios was to delete the Building. With this approach, all records related to the Building were actually deleted from the database. The Current Status property gives you another option. </p>
        <p>If you have records in the BUILDER database for a Building which is to be demolished or transferred to another owner, you can keep the inventory, inspection, and work history records in the BUILDER database but make the Building invisible to BUILDER’s automated processes simply by changing the Building's status to "Demolished" or "Transferred".</p>
        <p>Here is a summary of the BUILDER/Scenarios approach to a Building with status "Demolished" or "Transferred": </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Inventory records are locked. You will be unable to change the Building's data properties or its composition. </li>
            <li><a name="kanchor436"></a>Condition and Functionality Assessment records are locked.You will be unable to change existing records or to add new records. </li>
            <li>Work Planning records are locked. You will be unable to change existing records or to add new records. </li>
            <li>The Building's cost data will not be affected by annual cost updates at the beginning of the calendar year. </li>
            <li><a name="kanchor437"></a>The CI and RSL values for the Building and its Systems/Components/Sections will not be updated. </li>
            <li>The Building will not be considered during automatic work generation. </li>
            <li>If the Building will not appear in Scenarios simulations. </li>
            <li>If the Building's status is changed to "Demolished" or "Transferred" during a Scenarios simulation, it will have records for the years prior to its status change and then will be treated as it is in BUILDER. That is, there will be no further updates of data, no new inspections, no changes in condition or service life, etc. </li>
        </ul>
