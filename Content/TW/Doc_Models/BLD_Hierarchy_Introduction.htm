        <h1>Appendix A-1: BUILDER™ Inventory Hierarchy</h1>
        <!-- ALERT: this is not exactly the same as the corresponding document in BUILDER documentation: (1) First paragraph omitted. (2) product variable replaced by the physical word BUILDER. (3) snippets converted to text. (4) removed conditioning on references to Inventory chapters. Have NOT removed capital letters from inventory level names.  -->
        <!-- Omit, because reviewers don't get my talk of aggregation: <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/INV-Hierarchy-Default.flsnp" /> -->
        <p>The levels of hierarchy available in a BUILDER  inventory tree are as follows:</p>
        <ul class="nobul">
            <li><a name="kanchor1501"></a>Top node: This will be a single Organization or a single Site. The topmost position can not be shared; only one Organization or Site can be at the topmost level.</li>
            <li>
                <img src="../../Resources/ICONS/Organization_Gray_19x20.png" alt="organization icon" /> Organization (Having an Organization level is optional; if the top node is a Site, there can be no Organization in the tree)</li>
            <li>
                <img src="../../Resources/ICONS/Site_Gray_19x20.png" alt="site icon" /> Site</li>
            <li>
                <img src="../../Resources/ICONS/Complex_Gray_22x20.png" alt="complex icon" /> Complex</li>
            <li>
                <img src="../../Resources/ICONS/Building_Gray_20x20.png" alt="building icon" /> Facility / Building</li>
            <li>
                <img src="../../Resources/ICONS/System_icon.gif" alt="system icon" /> System</li>
            <li>
                <img src="../../Resources/ICONS/Component_icon.gif" alt="component icon" /> Component</li>
            <li>
                <img src="../../Resources/ICONS/Section_icon.gif" alt="section icon" /> Section</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Each of these levels is described briefly under headings below. </p>
        <h2>Icon Colors</h2>
        <p>Condition and functionality metrics  used in BUILDER  are communicated upwards through the hierarchy in weighted fashion. At each level of the hierarchy, the condition or functionality index for that level provides an understanding of the average condition/functionality of the real property contained in all the inventory items  under the specified Organization, Site, Complex, Building, System, or Component. The value of the index will determine whether the inventory icon for any given inventory item appears as green, amber, or red. Gray indicates that no assessment has been recorded in BUILDER  for anything under that asset. </p>
        <p data-mc-conditions="Primary.PrintOnly">The meaning of green, amber and red condition indexes are given in the <span class="span_9">BUILDER Condition Assessment Guide</span>, which can be downloaded from the SMS community user's group website at <a href="https://www.sms.erdc.dren.mil/" target="_blank">https://www.sms.erdc.dren.mil</a>.</p>
        <h2>Levels of Hierarchy</h2>
        <h3>Top node</h3>
        <p>Your inventory tree will have one and only one "node" at the top, typically named for your service branch, installation, or company. This can only be an Organization or a Site.</p>
        <h3>Organization </h3>
        <p>Organization is the highest possible level  in the inventory tree. However, it is not a required level. Depending on the scope of your BUILDER  implementation, it is possible to start with the Site level instead.</p>
        <p><a name="kanchor1502"></a>Unlike the other hierarchical levels, the Organization level may be nested more than one deep. When designing the inventory tree before implementing and filling out your inventory, it is important to accommodate in the inventory tree the highest possible Organization level you may want to expand to in the future. For more detail, see the section on implementation planning <!-- **afdo add link when this/these topic(s) is/are done -->.</p>
        <p>In the hierarchy tree, an Organization can have either (a)&#160;one or more Sites, (b)&#160;one or more Organizations, or (c)&#160;both created underneath it.</p>
        <p>For more information about this hierarchical level, see the "Working with Organizations" chapter in the <span class="ref-title">BUILDER™ Inventory Guide</span>.</p>
        <h3>Site</h3>
        <p>The level below Organization is the Site, which usually refers to a geographic location. The Area Cost Factor is one of the Location Factors that is set at the Site level.  Other features that are set at the Site level are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Seismic Zone</li>
            <li>HVAC Zone</li>
        </ul>
        <p><span class="more">In practice, a Site as a whole will typically have a facility manager who is responsible for day-to-day management of the Site, often with the assistance of subsidiary personnel.</span>
        </p>
        <p>Just as an Organization can have one or more Sites and/or other Organizations created underneath it, in the SMS hierarchy a Site  can have any combination of Complexes and/or Buildings beneath it. </p>
        <p>For more information, see the "Working with Sites" chapter in the <span class="ref-title">BUILDER™ Inventory Guide</span>.</p>
        <h3>Complex</h3>
        <div class="kt">
            <p>A Complex is an optional grouping of Buildings or facilities. This feature is particularly useful for groupings of Buildings with similar Building Use types or locations.</p>
        </div>
        <p>
            <p class="indent"><span class="span_1">Note:</span> Grouping Buildings into a Complex is done after creating the Buildings, not before.</p>
        </p>
        <p>For more information, see the "Working with Complexes" chapter in the <span class="ref-title">BUILDER™ Inventory Guide</span>.</p>
        <h3>Facility / Building<br /></h3>
        <p>A Building is a stand-alone building or other facility. At this level in the hierarchy, you can see details such as  year constructed, size/area, condition indexes, and work item history. Attachments such as floor plans and photographs can be associated with the Building level.</p>
        <p>For more information, see the "Working with Buildings" chapter in the <span class="ref-title">BUILDER™ Inventory Guide</span>.</p>
        <h3><a name="kanchor1503"></a>Systems, Components, and Sections</h3>
        <p>In BUILDER, a Building is divided in to Systems, then further divided into Components, following <a href="http://arc-solutions.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/Charette-Marshall-1999-UNIFORMAT-II-Elemental-Classification....pdf">ASTM UNIFORMAT II.</a> Systems equate to Level 2 Group Elements, and Components equate to Level 3 in the UNIFORMAT classification.</p>
        <p>Components are then divided into Component-Sections, also called Sections. It is at the Section level that inspection information is recorded into BUILDER.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
