        <h1>Working with Sites</h1>
        <hr style="text-align: left;" />
        <p>A Site is the level in Enterprise SMS that ties your real property inventory to a physical location. This topic briefly introduces the features of a Site and how to use it in organizing your real property inventory. It also provides links to the operations that can be performed at the Site level. </p>
        <hr style="text-align: left;" />
        <p>Your Enterprise SMS inventory can contain Buildings or facilities at a number of different geographic locations, or Sites. If this is the case, multiple Sites will be needed, one for each geographic location. Alternatively, if all Buildings or Facilities to be managed are in the same geographic location, one Site will generally suffice. </p>
        <h2>The Importance of Geography to the Site Level</h2>
        <p>Knowing the geographic location of a Building is extremely important; therefore it is necessary to create a Site record for each geographic location before you can add Buildings to the database.</p>
        <p>When creating a Site, keep in mind that the Site level is not simply a method for subdividing inventory. It is the level where geographic factors are incorporated into Enterprise SMS calculations, and therefore a Site needs to be confined to a relatively limited geographic area. A larger area can be covered by an Organization made up of multiple Sites.</p>
        <h2>Site-Level Properties</h2>
        <p>Several properties of Buildings are determined or affected by the Building's geographic location&#160;(Site), most critically the <MadCap:glossaryTerm glossTerm="Primary.Term1">Area Cost Factor</MadCap:glossaryTerm>. </p>
        <p>In addition to the <MadCap:glossaryTerm glossTerm="Primary.Term1">Area Cost Factor</MadCap:glossaryTerm>, the following properties are also affected by geographic location: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>HVAC&#160;Zone</li>
            <li>Seismic Zone</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Other factors that can be set at the Site level are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Selections for reference books such as cost book, inflation book, service life book, and/or component importance index (<MadCap:glossaryTerm glossTerm="Primary.Term19">CII</MadCap:glossaryTerm>) set. </li>
            <li>Policy sequence</li>
            <li>Prioritization scheme</li>
            <li>
                <MadCap:glossaryTerm glossTerm="Primary.Term34">FCI</MadCap:glossaryTerm>&#160;goal (for <MadCap:glossaryTerm glossTerm="Primary.Term8">POM</MadCap:glossaryTerm>&#160;Scenarios)</li>
            <li>Selection of cost modifier library</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Property Inheritance</h2>
        <p>Unlike <MadCap:glossaryTerm glossTerm="Primary.Term1">Area Cost Factor</MadCap:glossaryTerm>, HVAC zone, and seismic zone (which are set only at the Site level), the policy sequence, prioritization scheme, <MadCap:glossaryTerm glossTerm="Primary.Term34">FCI</MadCap:glossaryTerm>&#160;goal and selections for the cost book, inflation book, service life book, <MadCap:glossaryTerm glossTerm="Primary.Term19">CII</MadCap:glossaryTerm> set and cost modifier library can also be set at the Organization level. </p>
        <p>If the Site and Organization values differ, then the Site level settings take priority.</p>
        <h2>Site Tasks</h2>
        <p>Tasks that can be performed on Sites are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <MadCap:xref href="Add-A-Site.htm">Add a Site</MadCap:xref>
