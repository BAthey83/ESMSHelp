        <h1>Delete a Site</h1>
        <hr style="text-align: left;" />
        <p>This topic shows how to delete a Site, which also deletes all other records (Buildings, Systems, etc.) contained in the Site. </p>
        <hr style="text-align: left;" />
        <p style="margin-left: 32px;"><b>Permissions Note</b>:&#160;This action requires Administrator permissions. If the inventory item is empty of any contents, then the deletion may also be performed by a Master Planner with permission for the relevant location in Inventory. </p>
        <p style="margin-left: 0;font-weight: normal;">To delete a Site, navigate to it in the <b>Site Search</b> window and do the following:</p>
        <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
            <li style="font-weight: normal;">Select the Site you wish to delete in the <b>Site Search</b> window, and then click the Delete icon at the far right.</li>
            <li style="font-weight: normal;">Alternatively, you can select the Organizations button under the Inventory dropdown menu. Select your Organization, and then select the General tab, followed by the Sites menu. Here, you can select and delete the Site(s) as you wish. </li>
        </ol>
        <p style="font-weight: normal;margin-left: 32px;"><b>WARNING</b>: Deleting a Site deletes all inventory (Complexes, Buildings, Systems, Components, and Sections) in that Site. This is a significant step to take and should only be done when certain that you wish to clear the entire inventory of the selected Site. </p>
        <p style="font-weight: normal; margin-left: 32px;"><b>Best Practice Recommendation</b>:&#160;Making frequent backups of the inventory database will protect you from significant data losses if an unintended deletion is performed. </p>
