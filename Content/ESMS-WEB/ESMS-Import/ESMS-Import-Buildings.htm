        <p style="font-family: Arial;">
            <MadCap:keyword term="Assessment:Details" />To import data from BUILDER, you will need to create an import request specifying which sites you wish to be imported. This request is queued and processed. You can check on the status of the request to verify if it has been completed. 
		Request status is New when the request is created but not yet submitted. Status becomes Sent when the request is submitted and is being processed on the BUILDER side. Once BUILDER data is received, request status switches to In Progress and then to Done once processing is complete. 
			If the status does not change from Sent to In Progress for a while, that may be an indication of a problem on the BUILDER side. To verify, use the Check Status function on the Import Request Details dialog. 
			Error status indicates there is a problem processing the request on the ESMS side. Contact support if there is an error either on the BUILDER side or the ESMS side.</p>
        <p style="font-family: Arial;">
            <MadCap:keyword term="Search:Assessments" />The following data gets imported: Inventory, Assessments, Work Items, as well as some reference data. The items are added or updated if they already exist.</p>
