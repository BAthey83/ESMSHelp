        <h1><a name="kanchor65"></a><span class="Primaryone">Charter</span> Stage</h1>
        <p>This topic describes the <span class="Primaryone">Charter</span> stage of developing an ESMS assessment.</p>
        <p>After you have <a href="../00-About-and-Add/Add-Wkflow-Wkplan.htm">added an assessment into the Workflow Engine</a>, you can start the process of designing an assessment. There are <span class="PrimarynumberOfStages">six</span> stages to be navigated in the development process, with transitions between the steps that may require approvals. The stages are listed in <a href="../00-About-and-Add/Wkflow-About.htm" class="MCXref xref"> Understanding Assessments</a>. The transitions are guided by the user-defined <a href="../00-About-and-Add/Wkflow-About.htm#Scheme">scheme</a>. </p>
        <p style="font-variant: small-caps;font-size: 14pt;font-weight: bold;font-style: italic;">—Quick Links—</p>
        <p>Tasks at this stage are to</p>
        <ul>
            <li value="1">enter or edit assessment details, at the <a href="#Charter">Details</a> tab </li>
            <li value="2">view read-only assessment information that was set during assessment creation but can also be viewed, at the <a href="#Charter">Details</a> tab </li>
            <li value="3">select assets to be assessed, at the <a href="#Assets">Assets</a> tab</li>
            <li value="4">select Groups to work with, at the <a href="#$$Groups">Groups</a> tab</li>
            <li value="5">select planning team members, at the <a href="#%22Plan2">Pre-Assessment Team</a> tab</li>
            <li value="6"><a href="#Transiti">transition</a> to the next stage when done.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2><a name="Charter"></a><a name="kanchor66"></a>Details Tab</h2>
        <p>The <span class="span_1">Details</span> tab under Charter is the default tab that will show when you either (a) activate the <span class="Primaryone">Charter</span> stage of developing an assessment or (b) have just finished creating an assessment instance in Workflow.</p>
        <h3>Editable Fields</h3>
        <p>The <span class="span_1">Details</span> tab displays the following fields that can be edited:</p>
        <ul>
            <li value="1"><span class="span_1">Name </span>of the assessment </li>
            <li value="2"><span class="span_1">Project Charter</span>
            </li>
            <li value="3"><span class="span_1">Budget</span>
            </li>
            <li value="4"><span class="span_1">Planned Assessment Date</span> - To enter or change the planned assessment date, you can either enter the date into the field, or navigate into the field and activate the larger down triangle at the right side of the field to use the calendar tool. If the field contains real contents (rather than the mm/dd/yyyy format indicator), you can clear its contents by clicking the "x" in the field.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>At the bottom right of the screen is the <span class="span_1">Save</span> button, which will save the assessment details.  Next to the <span class="span_1">Save</span> button is the <span class="span_1">Delete</span> button. This will delete the entire assessment (after confirmation). </p>
        <h3>Read-Only Fields</h3>
        <p>The following fields can be viewed but not edited; they were entered when the assessment was created as described in <a href="../00-About-and-Add/Add-Wkflow-Wkplan.htm" class="MCXref xref">Add Assessment</a></p>
        <ul>
            <li value="1"><span class="span_1">Site</span> - Shows the Site that the assessment pertains to </li>
            <li value="2"><span class="span_1">Domain</span> - Shows the Domain that the assessment pertains to </li>
            <li value="3"><span class="span_1">Scheme</span> - Shows the scheme being used. If you want to know more about what a scheme is, see <a href="../00-About-and-Add/Wkflow-About.htm#Scheme" class="MCXref xref">Scheme</a> in <a href="../00-About-and-Add/Wkflow-About.htm" class="MCXref xref"> Understanding Assessments</a></li>
            <li value="4"><span class="span_1">Pre-Assessment Template</span> - Shows the pre-assessment template being used</li>
            <li value="5"><span class="span_1">Assessment Template</span> - Shows the assessment template being used</li>
        </ul>
        <p>At the bottom right of the screen is the <span class="span_1">Save</span> button, which will save the assessment details.  Next to the <span class="span_1">Save</span> button is the <span class="span_1">Delete</span> button. This will delete the entire assessment (after confirmation). </p>
        <h2><a name="kanchor67"></a><a name="Assets"></a>Assets Tab</h2>
        <p>At the <span class="span_1">Assets</span> tab, a listing of assets selected for assessment will appear. Here you can add assets that you want to assess and/or generate work against. You can also remove assets from the listing.</p>
        <h3>Add Asset to the List</h3>
        <p>To select one or more additional assets, </p>
        <ol>
            <li value="1">Activate the <span class="span_1">Assets</span> button below the listing. <span class="result">The "Asset Select" popup will appear</span>.

            <li value="2">Select one or more assets in the listing on the popup. 
				<p class="indent"><span class="span_1">Note:</span> Activating an asset will select it if it is not selected, or deselect it if it is selected. An asset will remain selected when you scroll, and will remain selected if you browse to other pages in the listing using the page ladder navigation below the listing of assets.</p></li>
            <li value="3">To narrow the selection of assets that will appear, you can enter search text in the box at the top of the popup, and then activate the <span class="span_1">Search</span> button. More detail about this search is included in the next step immediately below.</li>
            <li value="4">By default, the search is performed only on the <span class="span_1">Names</span> of the assets. However, if you want to search by another field such as Facility or RPUID, you can activate the gear button and designate a different field for the search. Only one field can be searched at a time.
				<p class="p_26"><img src="setup-imgs/change-asset-type-searched_400x150.png" alt="" style="width: 400;height: 150;" /></p></li>
            <li value="5">When you are satisfied with your selection, activate the <span class="span_1">Select</span> button at the bottom of the popup. (Alternatively, you can activate <span class="span_1">Close</span> to cancel the selection.) You will be returned to the <span class="span_1">Assets</span> tab on the <span class="Primaryone">Charter</span> screen, showing the <span class="span_1">Asset Selection</span> containing the original list of assets plus your additions.</li>

        </ol>
        <h2><a name="kanchor68"></a>Groups Tab</h2>
        <p>At the <span class="span_1">Groups</span> tab, a listing of groups selected for assessment will appear.  Here you can add groups that you want to assess and/or generate work against. You can also remove groups from the listing.</p>

        </p>
        <h3>Add Group to the List</h3>
        <p>The process of adding a group to the list happens in two sequential popups. In the first popup you filter by group type. In the second popup you select one or more groups from the list of groups that passed the filter. </p>
        <p>To select one or more additional groups, </p>
        <ol>
            <li value="1">Activate the <span class="span_1">Groups</span> button below the listing. <span class="result">The "Group Type Filter" popup will appear</span>.

            <li value="2">First, filter by group type: Select one or more group types in the listing on the popup. 
				<p class="indent"><span class="span_1">Note:</span> Activating a group type will select it if it is not selected, or deselect it if it is selected. A group type will remain selected when you scroll, and will remain selected if you browse to other pages in the listing using the page ladder navigation below the listing of group types.</p></li>

            <li value="5">Select one or more groups in the list.
			<p class="indent"><span class="span_1">Note:</span> As with selecting group types,  activating a group will select it if it is not selected, or deselect it if it is selected. A group will remain selected when you scroll, and will remain selected if you browse to other pages in the listing using the page ladder navigation below the listing of group types.</p></li>
            <li value="6">When you are satisfied with your selection, activate the <span class="span_1">Select</span> button at the bottom of the popup.
