        <h1><a name="kanchor96"></a><span class="Primarytwo">Pre-Assessment</span> Stage</h1>
        <p>This topic describes the <span class="Primarytwo">Pre-Assessment</span> stage of designing an ESMS assessment. This is the second of <span class="PrimarynumberOfStages">six</span> stages, to be performed after approval has been obtained to progress from the <span class="Primaryone">Charter</span> stage.</p>
        <p style="font-variant: small-caps;font-size: 14pt;font-weight: bold;font-style: italic;">—Quick Links—</p>
        <p>Tasks at this stage are to </p>
        <ul>
            <li value="1"> upload documents to be associated with the workflow; this is done at the <a href="#Document">Documents</a> tab </li>
            <li value="2">prepare the Pre-Assessment Questionnaire at the <a href="#Question">Questionnaire</a> tab</li>
            <li value="3">select assessment team members at the <a href="#%22Assessm">Assessment Team</a> tab
</li>
            <li value="4">review the assessment Questionnaire at the <a href="#Question2">Questionnaire Summary</a> tab </li>
            <li value="5"><a href="#Transiti">transition</a> to the next stage when done.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2><a name="Document"></a>Documents tab</h2>
        <p>At the <span class="span_1">Documents</span> tab, you can upload documents pertaining to the selected assets or to the workflow process in general. </p>
        <h3>Add Document</h3>
        <p>To add a document to the list of documents associated with the assessment,</p>
        <ol>
            <li value="1">Activate the <span class="span_1">Upload Files</span> button (located above the table of documents).</li>
            <li value="2">Browse to the file to be uploaded.</li>
            <li value="3">Activate the upload as appropriate for the browser (for example, activating the <span class="span_1">Open</span> button in the Chrome popup).
				<p class="indent"><span class="span_1">Note:</span> When you upload a document at the Pre-Assessment stage, it should also show up in the list of documents accessed via the <span class="span_1">Documents</span> tile on the ESMS dashboard. </p></li>
        </ol>
        <p>The document name should appear in the <span class="span_1">Name</span> column.</p>
        <h3>Remove a Document</h3>
        <p>The ability to remove a document from the list of associated documents is subject to your permission level.</p>
        <p>To remove a document, </p>
        <ol>
            <li value="1">Go to the ESMS dashboard (activate "Enterprise SMS" on the menu bar, upper left).</li>
            <li value="2">Activate the <span class="span_1">Documents</span> tile.</li>
            <li value="3">Find the document using Document Search and activate the "x" button in its row.</li>
        </ol>
        <h2><a name="Question"></a>Questionnaire Tab</h2>
        <p>The selection of questions that are presented at the <span class="span_1">Questionnaire</span> tab depends on various factors:</p>
        <ul>
            <li value="1">which pre-assessment template was selected during assessment creation</li>
            <li value="2">what assets were selected at the Charter stage</li>
            <li value="3">what groups were selected at the Charter stage</li>
            <li value="4">what pre-assessment team permissions were assigned (whether you have permission for the assets that the questions pertain to) </li>
            <li value="5">whether the questions pertain to your assigned discipline(s)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Select an asset in the box at the left. Any questions pertaining to that asset will appear at the right if (1) they pertain to your assigned discipline(s) and (2) you have permission for that asset.</p>
        <p class="indent"><span class="span_1">Note:</span> The loading might take a couple minutes.</p>
        <p>For each question that appears, select an answer from the answer options. Followup questions may dynamically appear, depending on whether a given answer is designed to trigger a followup question.</p>
        <h2><a name="&quot;Assessm"></a><a name="kanchor97"></a>"Assessment Team" Tab</h2>
