        <h1>Add Assessment</h1>
        <h2>Permissions Needed for Assessments/Workflow</h2>
        <ul>
            <li value="1">To edit or view information in stages of an assessment after it has been created, you need the ESMS permission named "Assessment Editor.". This can be set up either (a) as a scoped permission / role (restricted to a particular site), or (b) as a global permission, to edit or view any Assessment.</li>
            <li value="2">To create an assessment, one either with or without workflow, you need "AssessmentRole" permission. This permission allows you to activate the <span class="span_1">Save</span> button in the "Create Assessment" popup. It can be set up either (a) as a scoped permission / role (restricted to a particular site), or (b) as a global permission.</li>
            <li value="3">To see the <span class="span_1">Workflow Editor</span> tile on the Dashboard and to edit or create schemes that govern the workflow through an assessment, you need "WorkflowRole" permission. The "WorkflowRole" permission is global only.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>These permissions are granted by an ESMS administrator at the Security tile, <span class="span_1">Users</span> tab, <span class="span_1">Global Permissions</span> and/or <span class="span_1">User Workspace</span> section. </p>
        <h2>Create Assessment</h2>
        <p>To add a new assessment, activate the <span class="span_1">Create Assessment</span> button above the Assessment table. </p>
        <p class="p_26">
            <img src="add-workplan_675x207.png" alt="" style="width: 675;height: 207;" />
        </p>
        <p>Next you will enter data about the assessment. If applicable, this will include assigning individuals to permissions roles specified in the scheme.</p>
        <h2><a name="Enter2"></a>Enter Assessment Data - All Assessments</h2>
        <p>All assessments need the following at the "Create Assessment" popup:</p>
        <ol>
            <li value="1"><span class="span_1">Site.</span>  To initiate selecting a site, first activate the link icon (<img src="site-link-icon_25x22.png" class="icon" alt="" style="width: 25;height: 22;" />) at the left side of the field.
<span class="result">A new, smaller popup will appear.</span><![CDATA[				]]><p class="indent"><span class="span_1">Note:</span> Only one site may be selected for an assessment.</p></li>
            <li value="2">At the "Organization Selectors" popup, do one of the following: 
				<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;"><li value="1">Select one or more organizations to narrow the search field for sites. </li><li value="2">Alternatively,  mark the <span class="span_1">Select All</span> checkbox.</li></ol></li>
            <li value="3">Activate <span class="span_1">Next</span>. <span class="result">A list of sites, each with a checkbox next to it, will be constructed. Depending on the number and size of the selected organization(s), it may take some time for the list of sites to appear.</span></li>
            <li value="4">Check one and only one box to select the site.</li>
            <li value="5">Activate <span class="span_1">Close</span>. <span class="result">The popup will close and you will be back at "Create Assessment."</span></li>
            <li value="6"><span class="span_1">Domain.</span> Select a domain from the dropdown list.</li>

            <li value="9"><span class="span_1">Charter.</span> Some text for the assessment's charter must be entered here. You can later edit or expand on it at the <span class="span_1">Details</span> tab in the Charter stage. </li>
            <li value="10"><span class="span_1">Planned Assessment Date.</span> Enter or select the assessment date here. 
				<p class="indent"><span class="span_1">Tips:</span> To select, navigate into the field box and activate the larger down arrow to bring up a calendar tool. To clear the date, navigate into the field box and activate the "x" (the "x" will appear only if a date has been entered or selected).
				
			</p></li>
            <li value="11">Do one of the following based on whether the Workflow tool will be used for the assessment:<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;"><li value="1">If Workflow will not be used, skip to <a href="#Save" class="MCXref xref">Save and Create</a> in this topic.</li><li value="2">If Workflow will be used for the Assessment,  continue at <a href="#Enter" class="MCXref xref">Enter Workflow Data</a>.</li></ol></li>
        </ol>
        <h2><a name="Enter"></a>Enter Workflow Data</h2>
        <p class="indent2"><span class="span_1">Note:</span> If Workflow will not be used for the assessment, skip to <a href="#Save" class="MCXref xref">Save and Create</a> after completing the steps above in <a href="#Enter2" class="MCXref xref">Enter Assessment Data - All Assessments</a>.</p>
        <ol start="12">
            <li value="12">To continue, you must first mark the <span class="span_1">Enabled</span> checkbox to activate the remaining Workflow fields. <span class="result">(Shaded fields will become white.)</span><p class="p_26"><img src="setup-imgs/wkflow-enabled-ckbox.png" alt="" /></p></li>
            <li value="13"><span class="span_1">Scheme.</span> Select a scheme from the dropdown.
			</li>
            <p class="indent"><span class="span_1">IMPORTANT:</span> If you need to edit a scheme in order for it to appropriately guide the workflow of a given assessment, make sure to do all edits necessary BEFORE assigning the scheme to the assessment at the "Create Assessment" popup. The assessment will function from a snapshot of the scheme taken at the time of creating the assessment, and will not reflect any changes made later to the scheme.</p>
            <li value="14"><span class="span_1">Pre-Assessment Template.</span> Select a pre-assessment template from the dropdown.
			<p class="indent"><span class="span_1">Productivity Tip:</span> For selecting this template and the next one, you can type the first part of the template name in the blank field, to bring up a match.</p></li>
            <li value="15"><span class="span_1">Assessment Template.</span> Select a assessment template from the dropdown.</li>
            <li value="16"><span class="span_1">Permissions.</span> Do one of the following based on whether the <span class="span_1">Permissions</span> button is grayed out or active:<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;"><li value="1">If the <span class="span_1">Permissions</span> button is grayed out, no permission roles need to be assigned. Skip to <a href="#Save" class="MCXref xref">Save and Create</a>.</li><li value="2">If the <span class="span_1">Permissions</span> button is active (<span class="emph">not</span> grayed out), this means that the scheme you selected requires one or more people to be designated for roles that approve transitions from one stage to the next in the workflow. See the following list of instructions for how to designate permissions roles.</li></ol></li>
        </ol>
        <h2><a name="Permissi"></a><a name="kanchor6"></a>Permissions</h2>
        <p class="indent"><span class="span_1">Note:</span>  An assessment that does not use Workflow (and thus has no scheme) will not need Permissions.</p>
        <p>Depending on the scheme selected, role permissions may need to be set for the new assessment. If the <span class="span_1">Permissions</span> button near the bottom of the "Create Assessment" popup is active (not grayed out), this means that the scheme you selected requires one or more people to be designated for roles that approve transitions from one stage to the next in the workflow.</p>
        <p>If you need to know more about Workflow permissions or how to manage them, see the topic <a href="../../ESMS-WkflowEditor/wkflow-permission-manage.htm" class="MCXref xref">Manage Workflow Permissions</a> in the documentation about the Workflow editor.</p>
        <p>To assign users to permissions roles, </p>
        <ol>
            <li value="1">
                Activate the <span class="span_1">Permissions</span> button at the bottom of the "Create Assessment" popup. <span class="result">The "Set Permissions" popup should appear.</span><![CDATA[
                ]]><p class="indent"><span class="span_1">Note:</span> Before you can set permissions, all the previous fields in the "Create Assessment" popup must be filled in.</p>
            </li>
            <li value="2">In the "Set Permissions" popup, activate the <span class="span_1">Add More</span> button in a permissions category you want to add one or more users to. <span class="result">A popup will appear with a list of users to select from</span>. </li>
            <li value="3">If the user list spans multiple pages, you may need to bring appropriate names into view for selection as follows:<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;"><li value="1">Use the <span class="span_1">Name</span> search field and the <span class="span_1">Go</span> button to narrow down the selection list.</li><li value="2">As needed, use the pagination display at the bottom of the popup to step through the list of users. </li></ol></li>
            <li value="4">Select one or more users directly from the list as displayed in the popup. Activate an unselected name to select it, and activate a selected name to deselect it.</li>
            <li value="5">Activate the <span class="span_1">Select</span> button. <span class="result">You will be returned to the "Set Permissions" popup.</span> You may repeat the previous three steps and this one  as needed to select more users into the category.</li>
            <li value="6">As needed, move on to another category in the "Set Permissions" popup and repeat the process, until you are finished with selections.</li>
            <li value="7">When permissions are set for all desired users, activate the <span class="span_1">close </span>button in the "Set Permissions" popup. <span class="result">The "Set Permissions" popup will close, and your selections will be retained.</span><![CDATA[
				]]><p class="indent"><span class="span_1">IMPORTANT:</span> All permissions must be set at this stage before saving.</p></li>
            <li value="8">Next, be sure to save and create the assessment (or cancel, if desired), as described in <a href="#Save" class="MCXref xref">Save and Create</a>.</li>
        </ol>
        <h2><a name="Save"></a>Save and Create</h2>
        <p>To save the assessment data and create the assessment,  activate the <span class="span_1">Save</span> button at the lower right of the "Create Assessment" popup. </p>
        <p>Result: If all needed  information has been entered, the assessment will appear on a row of the <span class="span_1">Assessments</span> table.</p>
        <h2>Next Step</h2>
        <p>Next you can select the assessment in the table and you will be brought to the <span class="span_1">Details</span> tab of the <a href="../01-Charter/Charter-Stage.htm" class="MCXref xref">Charter Stage</a>. To access other tabs and stages,  use the <span class="span_1">Workflow</span> navigation tool (see <a href="Nav_work_plan.htm" class="MCXref xref">Work Plan Navigation</a> for instructions).</p>
