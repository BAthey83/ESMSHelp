        <hr />
        <p>This topic introduces tasks you can perform at the Inventory screen and provides links to greater detail for each. </p>

        <h2>What Can I Do Here?</h2>
        <p>
            <MadCap:keyword term="Add:component" />
            <MadCap:keyword term="Navigation Pane:configure" />The Inventory screen is where you search for organizations, facilities, groups, and components, applying filters if desired and narrowing your search to applicable sites and domains. You can also configure the resulting data by selecting the information fields of interest to you. </p>
        <p class="indent"><span class="span_1" style="font-weight: bold;">Note:</span> Before you begin a search, you must select at least one domain from the main menu bar dropdown. Selecting a site is optional (all sites permitted to you are active if you don't select a site).</p>
        <p>Once the results are delivered to the screen, you can access the detail pages for the resulting organizations, facilities, groups, or components. </p>
        <p>Alternatively, you can just begin at the starting page (which shows facilities by default) and navigate/drill down to the desired information.</p>
