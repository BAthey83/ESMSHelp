        <h1>About Replacement Cost Calculation</h1>
        <h2>Replacement Cost Level:&#160;Building vs. Component-Section</h2>
        <p>Only two levels of replacement costs are editable:&#160;the costs for Buildings, and the costs for Component-Sections. A Component's cost is determined by totaling the costs of the Component-Sections belonging to it. Similarly, a System's cost is determined by totaling the costs of the Components belonging to it.</p>
        <h2>Replacement Cost Formula</h2>
        <p>Generally, the cost to replace, remove, or paint a Component-Section is determined by the following formula: </p>
        <p style="text-align: center;">Total Cost = (Quantity) x (Unit Cost) x (Area Cost Factor) x (General Multiplier) x (Aggregate Specific Multiplier) x (Inflation Factor)</p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Here, the Aggregate Specific Multiplier is the product of the applicable individual specific multipliers and the Area Cost Factor is taken from the Site data. See the <MadCap:xref href="#Explanat">Explanation of Factors and Multipliers</MadCap:xref> for more about contributing factors and multipliers.</p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">The cost to demolish a Building uses the same formula, with the Aggregate Specific Multiplier = 1.0. </p>
        <h2>Replacement Cost Data Source </h2>
        <p>Enterprise SMS&#160;uses building replacement cost data from the Tri-Service Military Construction Program in the cost book, and the method described above is essentially the same as the method described in <i>Technical Manual 5-800-4, Programming Cost Estimates for Military Construction</i>, to estimate the replacement cost of each Building. See <a href="">https://www.wbdg.org/ffc/army-coe/technical-manuals-tm/tm-5-800-4</a> for the text of this technical manual. </p>
        <h2><a name="Explanat"></a>Explanation of Factors and Multipliers</h2>
        <h3 style="font-style: italic;">Area Cost Factor</h3>
        <p style="font-style: normal;">Costs relative to a specific geographic location are determined by applying a multiplier called the <i>Area Cost Factor</i> to a base construction cost. The Enterprise&#160;SMS database of Area Cost Factors is the same database used in the Tri-Service Automated Cost Engineering System (TRACES) and is set in the Site data. </p>
        <p style="font-style: normal;">The Area Cost Factor accounts for the following geographic differences in costs:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>local costs of construction labor, equipment, and materials</li>
            <li>weather, climate, and seismic requirements</li>
            <li>labor availability</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The Area Cost&#160;Factor is set at the Site inventory page (requires an elevated permissions level). </p>
        <h3 style="font-style: italic;">General Multipliers</h3>
        <p style="font-style: normal;">Each general multiplier, applied to all costs of a given level and activity type, is to cover costs including, but not limited to, supervision/administration, overhead, design, and contract management. </p>
        <h3 style="font-style: italic;">Specific Multipliers</h3>
        <p style="font-style: normal;">Specific multipliers account for the extra cost involved to replace, remove, paint, or inspect a Component-Section in a Building that is historic, high security, housing, or has additional access constraints or difficulties. Any given Component-Section can be assigned as many simultaneous specific multipliers as&#160;applied.</p>
        <h3 style="font-style: italic;">Inflation Factor</h3>
        <p style="font-style: normal;">The inflation factor is computed based on the base year of the cost data and the inflation rates given in the default <MadCap:xref href="Ref-Infltn-Bk.htm#Default">inflation book</MadCap:xref>. If the cost data corresponds to the data in the inflation cost book, then the cost module uses a fixed year for the base year. If you add your own cost book and enter a unit cost different from the inflation set, then the cost module saves the year in which you input that data as the base year for inflation computations.</p>
        <h2>Repair Costs</h2>
        <p>Repair costs are handled differently from replacement costs. The cost module calculates repair costs for Component-Sections as a function of current condition index and the replacement cost computed as above using an algorithm derived through <MadCap:glossaryTerm glossTerm="Primary.Term13">ERDC-CERL</MadCap:glossaryTerm>'s research. </p><pre>Related Links</pre>
