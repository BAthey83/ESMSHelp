        <hr style="font-family: Arial;text-align: left;" />
        <p style="text-align: left;">Data regarding the service life expectancy, in years, of all types of Building Component-Sections is built into Enterprise SMS. The data Enterprise SMS&#160;uses in contained in one or more <i>service life books</i>. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">A&#160;default service life book is provided and is all that is required. Optionally, a customized service life book can be used in place of the default, or multiple customized service life books can be created in association with different Organizations. </p>
        <hr style="font-family: Arial;text-align: left;" />
        <p style="margin-top: 0;margin-bottom: 0;margin-left: 32px;text-align: left;"><b>Permissions Note</b>:&#160;Depending on the operation (such as adding vs. deleting a book), configuring reference data requires Administrator permissions for the Organization's reference book. 
		The ability to assign a custom reference book to an Organization depends on your permissions for that Organization. </p>
			&#160;<p style="margin-top: 0;margin-bottom: 0;margin-left: 0;text-align: left;">Enterprise SMS&#160;comes with its own data regarding the service life expectancy, in years, of all types of Building Component-Sections. It uses the expected service life data to:</p><ul><li style="text-align: left;">Estimate the remaining service life of a Component-Section on the basis of its life expectancy and condition.</li><li style="text-align: left;">Estimate the rate of deterioration in the condition index of a Component-Section when no more than one inspection has been recorded.</li></ul><h2 style="text-align: left;">Service Life Data</h2><p style="text-align: left;">The service life data used by Enterprise SMS&#160;is contained in one or more <i>service life books</i>. Multiple service life books can be associated with different
		 Organizations within Enterprise SMS, as needed.</p><h3 style="font-style: italic;text-align: left;">Default Service Life Book</h3><p style="font-style: normal;text-align: left;">The default service life book provided with Enterprise SMS  and it is associated with the top level of the Organization. 
		The scope of its data, therefore, is the entire Organization.</p><p style="font-style: normal;text-align: left;">You can choose to depend exclusively on the data in the default service life book, or you can create one or more custom service life books.</p><h3 style="font-style: italic;text-align: left;">Custom Service Life Book(s)</h3><p style="font-style: normal;text-align: left;">To create custom service life data, you can either:</p><ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;"><li style="text-align: left;">Edit an existing service life book, or</li><li style="text-align: left;">Create one or more new service life books. You can use an existing service life book as the starting point for the new service life book.</li></ol><p style="text-align: left;">By assigning
		 a custom service life book to an Organization, you can control the scope of that service life book, applying custom values to either all or part of the Organization.</p><p style="margin-top: 0;margin-bottom: 0;margin-left: 32px;text-align: left;"><b>Note</b>:&#160;The only data that you can change in the service life book is the service life and paint life for each Component-Section as needed. </p><h2 style="text-align: left;"><a name="Assign"></a>Assign a Service Life Book to an Organization</h2><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">You can create multiple service life books, and assign a separate book to any Organization within your permissions scope, as desired. 
		    This is done as follows:</p><ol style="text-align: center;"><li style="text-align: left;">Select an Organization by clicking the <b>Current Organization</b> button. </li><li style="text-align: left;">The "Select Organization" popup will appear. Here, you will choose an Organization that has been assigned to you (elevated permissions required). </li><li style="text-align: left;">Activate "Close"&#160;after choosing your Organization.</li><li style="text-align: left;">Select the <b>Service Life</b> button under the <b>Reference Books</b> drop-down. </li><li style="font-style: normal;text-align: left;">Choose the Service Life book you wish to assign to your Organization. </li><p style="font-style: normal; text-align: left;"><b style="font-style: italic;">Note</b><i>:
			&#160;if you do not have any Service Life books assigned to your Organization, select the "</i><b style="font-style: italic;">+</b><i>"&#160;icon above to create a new Service Life book.</i></p><img src="imgs/Serv-Life-Book-Copy.png" style="width: 468px;height: 392px;" /><li style="font-style: normal;text-align: left;">If you wish to copy data from one Service Life Book to another, click the <b>Copy Existing Book</b> dropdown menu
				 within the <b>Create Service Life Book</b> popup menu after you have started a new Service Life Book.</li><li style="font-style: normal; text-align: left;">After you have selected the Service Life Book you wish to copy, select <b>Create</b> to begin your new Service Life Book.</li></ol><h2 style="text-align: left;">How ESMS Gathers Service Life Data</h2><p style="text-align: left;">The following is an example of how Enterprise SMS&#160;gathers Service Life data. </p><p style="text-align: left;">Imagine a heavy-graded carpet placed in an area with moderate foot traffic. The carpet has a 20-year life expectancy. The life expectancy data is an average. 
			The final average is determined more by the specialized expertise of multiple facility managers than by statistically precise field data. </p><p style="text-align: left;">Gathering statistically precise data is virtually impossible — even for the carpet's manufacturer. As for the Enterprise SMS database, it must match service life 
		    data with a generic Component-Section type to create a final, useable average. </p><p style="text-align: left;">If a heavy-grade carpet was installed into 1,000 Buildings with moderate foot traffic, and you tracked how many years each carpet remained in the Building before it was replaced, 
		    the following graph may resemble your data. </p><p style="text-align: left;margin-top: 0;margin-bottom: 0;margin-left: 32px;">(<b>Note</b>: this graph is being used for illustrative purposes only. No existing data is represented). 
			</p><img src="imgs/Serv-Life-Graph.png" /><p style="text-align: left;">As this graph shows, by year 20, the bulk of the  buildings have replaced their carpet. Along the way, some carpet is replaced sooner than the 20-year estimate,
			 while some is being replaced later. Several variables affect how long the carpet may be used, such as the level of cleaning, climate factors, carpet quality, installation quality, and the tenant's mission requirements. </p><p style="text-align: left;">For factors affecting the carpet's condition,
			 Enterprise SMS attempts to relate an estimated <MadCap:glossaryTerm glossTerm="Primary.Term11">RSL</MadCap:glossaryTerm> for a specific 
			carpet's Component-Section with the <MadCap:glossaryTerm glossTerm="Primary.Term18">CI</MadCap:glossaryTerm> of that section. 
			The CI of the carpet at any given age indicates whether the carpet will last less or more than the average lifespan. </p><p style="text-align: left;">When you roll up the CIs for your inventory, one of the primary calculations recomputes the RSL of the Component-Section based on its current CI, 
			its rate of deterioration during the time between its last two condition assessments, 
		    and the item's expected service life. </p><p style="text-align: left;">The expected service life is a key component that determines two important measures of how well a particular Component-Section is performing. 
			The two measurements are its current condition index and its remaining service life. </p><p style="text-align: left;">Service life is used to determine an expected deterioration rate in estimating the current condition in the absence of sequential condition assessment data. 
		    It is also used in the models that compute the remaining service life on the basis of current CI and the rate of deterioration. </p><h2 style="text-align: left;">Source of Service Life Data</h2><p style="text-align: left;">The service life data in Enterprise SMS is
			 derived from data collected at <MadCap:glossaryTerm glossTerm="Primary.Term13">ERDC-CERL</MadCap:glossaryTerm> over 
			many years of research. This research includes the former BUILDER&#160;web resource project as well 
			as an earlier study that resulted in the Maintenance Resource Prediction Model (MRPM). The MRPM&#160;has served as the foundation for a number of facility maintenance models.</p><p style="text-align: left;">Your experience, however, may vary in terms of how long items last in your Buildings. For example, your Buildings may be in a 
			very wet, windy climate. As a result, the roof surfaces may need to be replaced more often, paint may need to be re-applied more frequently, and wood windows may need replacing sooner than the data indicates. 
			Enterprise SMS&#160;lets you edit the service life data to reflect your knowledge and experience with the various Building Components you manage. </p><h2 style="text-align: left;">Service Life Book Tasks</h2><ul><li style="text-align: left;"><MadCap:xref href="Add-Serv-Life-Bk.htm">Add a Service Life Book</MadCap:xref></li><li style="text-align: left;"><MadCap:xref href="Edit-Serv-Life-Bk.htm">Edit a Service Life Book</MadCap:xref></li><li style="text-align: left;"><MadCap:xref href="Del-Serv-Life-Bk.htm">Delete a Service Life Book</MadCap:xref></li><li style="text-align: left;"><MadCap:xref href="#Assign">Assign a Service Life Book to an Organization</MadCap:xref></li></ul></body>
