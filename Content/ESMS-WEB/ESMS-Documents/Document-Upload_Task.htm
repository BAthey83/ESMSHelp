        </ol>
        <p style="font-family: Arial;">See <MadCap:xref href="#Which">Which Method To Use?</MadCap:xref> immediately below for advice which method to use.</p>
        <hr style="font-family: Arial;" />
        <h2 style="font-family: Arial;"><a name="Which"></a>Which Method To Use?</h2>
        <p style="font-family: Arial;">If you want to associate the documents to be uploaded with one or a few already existing components, and there are only a couple documents per component to upload, you may find it most convenient to do upload and association in one step at the  Component Details screen for each of the components involved. The main disadvantage with this method is that you can upload only one document at a time.</p>
        <p style="font-family: Arial;">For a large number of documents, it's better to upload files in bulk <MadCap:xref href="#Upload2">at the documents screen</MadCap:xref>.</p>
        <h2 style="font-family: Arial;"><a name="Upload2"></a>
            <MadCap:keyword term="Upload Document:At Tools &gt; Documents;Document:Upload at Tools &gt; Documents" />Upload Documents at the Documents Screen</h2>
        <p class="indent" style="font-family: Arial;"><span class="span_1" style="font-weight: bold;">Note:</span> This section contains instructions for uploading documents in bulk using the <b>Upload Files</b> button at the Documents screen. The other method for associating a document with a component is done <MadCap:xref href="#Upload">at the component's detail screen</MadCap:xref>.</p>
        <p class="indent" style="font-family: Arial;"><span class="span_1" style="font-weight: bold;">CAUTION:</span> When uploading documents according to instructions in this section, association with a component does not automatically take place. This must be done in a separate step, described in the topic <MadCap:xref href="Document-CMP-assn_Task.htm">Associate Document(s) with a Component</MadCap:xref>. An alternative is to <MadCap:xref href="#Upload">upload documents at the component details screen</MadCap:xref> of a component, in which case they are automatically associated with that component. </p>

            <MadCap:keyword term="Domain:Select" />Select and Upload File(s) </h3>
        <p style="font-family: Arial;">To select  one or more files to be uploaded,</p>
        <ol>
            <li style="font-family: Arial;">At the Documents screen, activate the <span class="span_1" style="font-weight: bold;">Upload Files</span> accordion button if that section isn't already open.	
</li>
            <li style="font-family: Arial;">Activate the <span class="span_1" style="font-weight: bold;">Choose Files</span> button.</li>
            <li style="font-family: Arial;">As prompted, navigate in the file system to the file location of one or more documents/images you want to upload.
				<p class="indent"><span class="span_1" style="font-weight: bold;">Productivity Tip:</span> At <span class="span_1" style="font-weight: bold;">Upload Files</span><MadCap:keyword term="Component:add" />, 
				you have the standard file selection options available, such as 
				(a)&#160;CTRL-click to add an additional single document to the selection, or 
				(b)&#160;click-SHIFT-click to select a contiguous range of files, etc.</p></li>
            <li style="font-family: Arial;">Select the files representing the images or other documents you want to upload.
<i>A "Queue progress:" bar will show status of the upload. When the bar is solid blue, the upload is complete. In the list of documents in the Bulk Upload section, fully uploaded documents will be so indicated by a checkmark in the "Status" column.</i><p class="indent"><span class="span_1"><MadCap:keyword term="Search Results:Troubleshooting" /><b>Troubleshooting Tip:</b></span><MadCap:keyword term="Component:view" /> The name of the newly uploaded document(s) might not appear in the list of documents right away. If this is the case, and you want to view or perform an action on the document(s) right away, activate the "Next" link between the list of documents and the accordion buttons, then navigate back using the "Previous" link. (Refreshing the browser will not necessarily work.)</p> </li>
            <li style="font-family: Arial;">To clear the list of uploaded documents, activate the <span class="span_1" style="font-weight: bold;">Clear Queue</span> button.	</li>

        <p class="indent" style="font-family: Arial;"><span class="span_1" style="font-weight: bold;">Best Practice:</span> For any uploaded documents that should be associated with one or more components, it's best to do this association promptly at the time of upload.</p>
        <p style="font-family: Arial;">See the topic <MadCap:xref href="Document-CMP-assn_Task.htm">Associate Document(s) with a Component</MadCap:xref> for how to associate uploaded documents with their respective components.</p>
