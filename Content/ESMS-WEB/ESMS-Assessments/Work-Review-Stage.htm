            <MadCap:keyword term="Add:Team" />This topic describes the <b>Review</b> stage of designing an ESMS assessment plan. The idea is that here, a different team can check over the information before synchronizing to ESMS Desktop in preparation for the assessment plan. This is the third of five stages, to be performed after approval has been obtained to progress from the <MadCap:xref href="Work-Pre-Assessment-Stage.htm"><MadCap:keyword term="Pre-Assessment Plan" />Pre-Assessment Plan</MadCap:xref> stage. After you complete the <b>Review</b> stage, there will be tasks to be performed outside of ESMS Web in the <MadCap:xref href="Work-Desktop Sync-Stage.htm">following stage</MadCap:xref>.</p>
