        <!-- My original ambition, for later:
		<p>This topic contains explanatory materials about
		the condition index and remaining service life thresholds used for work item generation, and lists the steps for setting values for these thresholds at the Work screen.</p>

        <h2>How to Set the Standards</h2>
        <h3>CI Threshold</h3>
        <p>
            <MadCap:keyword term="Add:component" />This threshold triggers work items based on a component's condition index.</p>
        <p>In the CI Threshold field, enter the CI value at and below which a work item should be triggered.</p>
        <h3>RSL Threshold</h3>
        <p>This threshold triggers work items based on a component's remaining service life.</p>
        <p>In the RSL Threshold field, enter the CI value at and below which a work item should be triggered.</p>
