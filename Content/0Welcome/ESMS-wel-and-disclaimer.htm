        <h1>Welcome</h1>
        <h2>Welcome to Enterprise SMS</h2>
        <p>The Enterprise version of the Sustainment Management System (SMS)   is the newest version under development by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers at its Engineering Research and Development Center–Construction Engineering Research Laboratory (ERDC-CERL) in Champaign, IL. </p>
        <p>In contrast to legacy versions of the Sustainment Management System, which continue to be offered side by side with Enterprise SMS, the Enterprise version combines into one software program the information and capabilities formerly contained in separate products.  Users can import and access real property information from multiple domains formerly isolated from each other in separate products such as BUILDER™, RAILER™, and ROOFER™. This information can be utilized one domain at a time, or information from two or more domains can be viewed simultaneously.</p>
        <p>Enterprise SMS is currently available in two formats:</p>
        <ol>
            <li value="1"><span class="span_1">Enterprise SMS Web (ESMS Web)</span>. This version is optimized for information search and for generating work items using condition and remaining service life criteria.</li>
            <li value="2"><span class="span_1">ESMS Field Application</span>. This version contains both a Desktop application and a Tablet application. The Desktop version of Enterprise SMS allows users to create and access both real property inventory and assessment information, and to create and manage assessments for real property repair and replacement. The Tablet version allows users to perform assessments in the field using a tablet. </li>
        </ol>
        <p>Once data has been entered or imported, automated tools in the ESMS support engineering and facility management decisions regarding when, where, and how best to maintain real assets
<!--buildings, roofs, pavements, rail lines, fuel lines, utilities, -->
			and their key components. For example, deterioration curves, developed from experience over time, show the optimal point at which work should be done to avoid more costly rehabilitation projects later.</p>
