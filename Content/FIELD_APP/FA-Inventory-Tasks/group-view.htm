        <p>To see what groups are currently in use, having member components,</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <MadCap:keyword term="Document Tag:Add" />Add the <span class="span_1">Groups</span><MadCap:keyword term="Layout:navigation pane" /> tab to the navigation pane if it's not already there (to do so, activate <span class="span_1">Groups</span> in the ribbon at the <span class="span_1">Home</span> tab).</li>
            <li>In the navigation pane, select the <span class="span_1">Groups</span> tab.</li>
            <li>Expand the list. A quick way to show group-types and groups, as well as their member assets, is to use the <img class="icon" src="../0First-Steps/start-imgs/btn-expand-asset-tree.png" alt="expand" /> (Expand All) button. Alternatively, click the arrow to the left of the site name to show the list of group-types in use; then click the arrow left of the desired group-type to view its groups. </li>
        </ol>
        <h2>See Members of an Individual Group $$Group Manager probably does this. Revisit when Group Manager has been fixed.</h2>
        <p>To see what components are in a particular group,</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Follow the steps in <MadCap:xref href="#See">See Groups Being Used.</MadCap:xref></li>
            <li>To find the desired group, either (a) browse the expanded list or (b) use the search bar. The search bar is located immediately below the Expand All and Contract All buttons.</li>
            <li>Members of the group will be displayed in an indented list below the group name.</li>
        </ol>
        <h2>See Available Groups</h2>
        <p>To see all groups that are available,</p>
        <ol>
            <li>At the <span class="span_1">Tools</span> tab, activate <span class="span_1">Group Editor</span> in the ribbon. <span class="result">A <span class="span_1">Group Editor</span> tab will appear in the content pane, listing all group types in the left sub-pane.</span></li>
            <li>Above the list of group types, activate the <span class="span_1">Domains</span> button to select applicable domains. By default, all domains are active in the Group Editor.</li>
            <li>Activate a group type to see a listing of its groups in the right sub-pane.</li>
