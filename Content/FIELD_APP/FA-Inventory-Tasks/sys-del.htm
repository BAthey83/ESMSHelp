        <ol>
            <li>At the <span class="span_1">Tools</span> tab, activate <span class="span_1">Group Editor</span> in the ribbon. A <span class="span_1">Group Editor</span> tab will open in the content pane.</li>
            <li>In the list of group types (located at the left side of the content pane), activate "System".
<span class="result">A listing of all systems will appear to the right, along with the importance factor percentage for each.</span><![CDATA[			]]><p class="center"><img src="../Desk-imgs/system-as-group-type.PNG" alt="" /></p></li>
            <li>
                <MadCap:keyword term="Domain:Select" />Select the system you wish to delete: check that it is highlighted.</li>
            <li>Make note of the number in the  "Importance Factor (%)" column for the system about to be deleted.</li>
            <li>Activate the <span class="span_1">Delete Group</span> button (located in the cluster of buttons at the upper right of the content pane). <span class="result">The "Delete Alert" popup will appear, revealing the number of components contained in the system to be deleted.</span></li>

                <MadCap:keyword term="Document Tag:Add" />In the column labeled "Importance Factor (%)" , adjust one or more numbers upwards to compensate for the number associated with the deleted system.

Even though you have confirmed, in the popup, your desire to delete the group, activating <span class="span_1">Save Systems</span> button is still required for the deletion to take effect.</li>
