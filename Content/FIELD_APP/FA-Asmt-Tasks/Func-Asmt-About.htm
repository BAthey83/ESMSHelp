The development phase consists of designing evaluation questions and their respective options for answers. These are then entered into Enterprise SMS Web, by an Administrator, as the assessment template.</p>
        <p>After the template is complete and installed,  an individual functional assessment can be created, viewed, or deleted by other users.</p>
