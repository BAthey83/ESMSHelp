        <h2 class="notoc">Automated Rollup</h2>
        <p>BUILDER automatically "rolls up" inventory, condition, and functionality information nightly. (For installations with U.S. Army Corps of Engineers support service, this begins at about 6:00 p.m.). Starting at the Section level, aggregated Section-level information in each Component is recorded for the Component; aggregated Component-level information is recorded for each System; aggregated System-level information is recorded for each Building, and so forth up the entire inventory tree.</p>
